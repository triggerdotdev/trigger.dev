Almost all commands in the monorepo should be executed when `pnpm run ...` from the root of the monorepo. For example, running tests for the `@internal/run-engine` internal package:

```
pnpm run dev --filter webapp
```

But often, when running tests, it's better to `cd` into the directory and then run tests:

```
cd apps/webapp
pnpm run test --run
```

This way you can run for a single file easily:

```
cd internal-packages/run-engine
pnpm run test ./src/engine/tests/ttl.test.ts --run
```
