The main trigger.dev webapp, which powers it's API and dashboard and makes up the docker image that is produced as an OSS image, is a Remix 2.1.0 app that uses an express server, written in TypeScript. The following subsystems are either included in the webapp or are used by the webapp in another part of the monorepo:

- `@trigger.dev/database` exports a Prisma 6.14.0 client that is used extensively in the webapp to access a PostgreSQL instance. The schema file is [schema.prisma](mdc:internal-packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma)
- `@trigger.dev/core` is a published package and is used to share code between the `@trigger.dev/sdk` and the webapp. It includes functionality but also a load of Zod schemas for data validation. When importing from `@trigger.dev/core` in the webapp, we never import the root `@trigger.dev/core` path, instead we favor one of the subpath exports that you can find in [package.json](mdc:packages/core/package.json)
- `@internal/run-engine` has all the code needed to trigger a run and take it through it's lifecycle to completion.
- `@trigger.dev/redis-worker` is a custom redis based background job/worker system that's used in the webapp and also used inside the run engine.

## Environment variables and testing

In the webapp, all environment variables are accessed through the `env` export of [env.server.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/env.server.ts), instead of directly accessing `process.env`.

Ideally, the `env.server.ts` file would never be imported into a test file, either directly or indirectly. Tests should only imported classes and functions from a file matching `app/**/*.ts` of the webapp, and that file should not use environment variables, everything should be passed through as options instead. This "service/configuration" separation is important, and can be seen in a few places in the code for examples:

- [realtimeClient.server.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/services/realtimeClient.server.ts) is the testable service, and [realtimeClientGlobal.server.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/services/realtimeClientGlobal.server.ts) is the configuration

Also for writing tests in the webapp, checkout our [tests.md](mdc:ai/references/tests.md) guide

## Legacy run engine vs Run Engine 2.0

We originally the Trigger.dev "Run Engine" not as a single system, but just spread out all over the codebase, with no real separate or encapsulation. And we didn't even call it a "Run Engine". With Run Engine 2.0, we've completely rewritten big parts of the way the system works, and moved it over to an internal package called `@internal/run-engine`. So we've retroactively named the previous run engine "Legacy run engine". We're focused almost exclusively now on moving to Run Engine 2.0 and will be deprecating and removing the legacy run engine code eventually.

## Where to look for code

- The trigger API endpoint is [api.v1.tasks.$taskId.trigger.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/routes/api.v1.tasks.$taskId.trigger.ts)
- The batch trigger API endpoint is [api.v1.tasks.batch.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/routes/api.v1.tasks.batch.ts)
- Setup code for the prisma client is in [db.server.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/db.server.ts)
- The run engine is configured in [runEngine.server.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/v3/runEngine.server.ts)
- All the "services" that are found in app/v3/services/\*_/_.server.ts
- The code for the TaskEvent data, which is the otel data sent from tasks to our servers, is in both the [eventRepository.server.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/v3/eventRepository.server.ts) and also the [otlpExporter.server.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/v3/otlpExporter.server.ts). The otel endpoints which are hit from production and development otel exporters is [otel.v1.logs.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/routes/otel.v1.logs.ts) and [otel.v1.traces.ts](mdc:apps/webapp/app/routes/otel.v1.traces.ts)
- We use "presenters" to move more complex loader code into a class, and you can find those are app/v3/presenters/\*_/_.server.ts
