# Guidance for Coding Agents

This repository is a pnpm monorepo managed with Turbo. It contains multiple apps and packages that make up the Trigger.dev platform and SDK.

## Repository layout
- `apps/webapp` – Remix application that serves as the main API and dashboard.
- `apps/supervisor` – Node application for executing built tasks.
- `packages/*` – Published packages such as `@trigger.dev/sdk`, the CLI (`trigger.dev`), and shared libraries.
- `internal-packages/*` – Internal-only packages used by the webapp and other apps.
- `references/*` – Example projects for manual testing and development of new features.
- `ai/references` – Contains additional documentation including an overview (`repo.md`) and testing guidelines (`tests.md`).

See `ai/references/repo.md` for a more complete explanation of the workspaces.

## Development setup
1. Install dependencies with `pnpm i` (pnpm `8.15.5` and Node.js `20.11.1` are required).
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and generate a random 16 byte hex string for `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`openssl rand -hex 16`). Update other secrets if needed.
3. Start the local services with Docker:
   ```bash
   pnpm run docker
   ```
4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   pnpm run db:migrate
   ```
5. Build the webapp, CLI and SDK packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build --filter webapp && pnpm run build --filter trigger.dev && pnpm run build --filter @trigger.dev/sdk
   ```
6. Launch the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev --filter webapp
   ```
   The webapp runs on <http://localhost:3030>.

For full setup instructions see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Running tests
- Unit tests use **vitest**. Run all tests:
  ```bash
  pnpm run test
  ```
- Run tests for a specific workspace (example for `webapp`):
  ```bash
  pnpm run test --filter webapp
  ```
- Prefer running a single test file from within its directory:
  ```bash
  cd apps/webapp
  pnpm run test ./src/components/Button.test.ts
  ```
  If packages in that workspace need to be built first, run `pnpm run build --filter webapp`.

Refer to `ai/references/tests.md` for details on writing tests. Tests should avoid mocks or stubs and use the helpers from `@internal/testcontainers` when Redis or Postgres are needed.

## Coding style
- Formatting is enforced using Prettier. Run `pnpm run format` before committing.
- Follow the existing project conventions. Test files live beside the files under test and use descriptive `describe` and `it` blocks.
- Do not commit directly to the `main` branch. All changes should be made in a separate branch and go through a pull request.

## Additional docs
- The root `README.md` describes Trigger.dev and links to documentation.
- The `docs` workspace contains our documentation site, which can be run locally with:
  ```bash
  pnpm run dev --filter docs
  ```
- `references/README.md` explains how to create new reference projects for manual testing.
