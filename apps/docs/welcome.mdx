Trigger.dev is an open source platform that makes it easy for developers to create event-driven background tasks directly in their code. Build, test and run workflows locally. Subscribe to webhooks, schedule jobs, run background jobs and add long delays easily and reliably. Not only that, but you get full visibility of every run your workflow has ever made in our web app.

Workflows live in your codebase so you can use your existing types, functions, version control and IDE. They are triggered by us but run on your server so your private data is never exposed.
