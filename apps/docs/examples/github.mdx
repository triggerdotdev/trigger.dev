  name: "New GitHub Star: triggerdotdev/trigger.dev",
  apiKey: "<my_api_key>",
  on: github.events.newStarEvent({
    repo: "triggerdotdev/trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (event) => {
    await slack.postMessage("github-stars", {
      channelName: "github-stars",
      text: `New GitHub star from \n<${event.sender.html_url}|${event.sender.login}>`,
    });
  },
