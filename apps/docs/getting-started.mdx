<Warning>
  Trigger.dev is in private beta and invite only. [Join the waitlist
  here.](https://bcymafitv0e.typeform.com/tddsignup?typeform-source=trigger.dev#source=Docs)
</Warning>

Trigger.dev workflows are written in your codebase and run in your existing infrastructure. This means:

- They are version controlled with the rest of your code.
- They run locally and don't require you to use tunnels.

<Note>
  Currently we require you to have a long-running Node.js server, e.g. Express.
  Support for serverless is coming soon.
</Note>

## 1. Installing @trigger.dev packages

In your existing project install the packages:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="npm">

```bash
npm install @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger.dev/integrations zod
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm install @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger.dev/integrations zod
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger.dev/integrations zod
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

What do the packages do?

- `@trigger.dev/sdk` is required to use Trigger.dev, it allows you to run workflows.
- `@trigger.dev/integrations` allows you to easily subscribe to webhooks and use API calls from popular services.
- `zod` is used to define schemas (the expected shape of an object).

## 2. Sign in to your Trigger.dev dashboard

Go to [trigger.dev](https://app.trigger.dev) and sign up or login to your account.

## 3. Get your API keys

In the bottom-left corner of an Organization page you can find your API keys.

## 4. Creating your first workflow

Workflows are triggered by events. In this example, we have defined a custom event called `user.created`. We support many different types of events including webhooks, scheduled, and more coming soon.

```ts first-workflow.ts
import { Trigger, customEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { slack } from "@trigger.dev/integrations";
import { z } from "zod";

const postMessage = new Trigger({
  id: "new-user",
  name: "New user slack message",
  apiKey: "<your_api_key>",
  logLevel: "info",
  on: customEvent({
    name: "user.created",
    schema: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      email: z.string(),
      paidPlan: z.boolean(),
    }),
  }),
  run: async (event, ctx) => {
    await ctx.logger.info("This log will appear on the Trigger.dev run page");

    //send a message to the #new-users Slack channel with user details
    const response = await slack.postMessage("send-to-slack", {
      channel: "new-users",
      text: `New user: ${event.name} (${event.email}) signed up. ${
        event.paidPlan ? "They are paying" : "They are on the free plan"
      }.`,
    });

    return response.message;
  },
});

//this workflow will now connect and start listening for events
postMessage.listen();
```

You'll notice that when we subscribe to the custom event we have to say the name of the event and provide a schema. Schemas are created using Zod. In this case events must send an object that has `name`, `email`, and `paidPlan`.

<Note>
  If the event is triggered with an object that doesn't match this schema, the
  workflow won't run.
</Note>

<Note>
  Above we set the API key inside the Trigger object. We recommend instead that
  you add an environment variable called `TRIGGER_API_KEY`. That way you can use
  your development API key locally and the production one when you deploy.
</Note>

## 6. Run your web server

Run your server how you normally would, e.g. `npm run dev`. This will connect your workflow to Trigger.dev, so we can start sending you events. You should see some log messages in your server console (tip: you can turn these off by removing the `logLevel: "info"` from the code above).

## 5. Testing your workflow from the dashboard

Now that the workflow is connected to Trigger.dev we need to trigger it. You can easily test your workflow from [your Trigger.dev dashboard](https://app.trigger.dev).

On the organization page you should see that the Workflow has now appeared (you may need to refresh the page from last time).

!["New user slack message" workflow](/images/workflow.png)

Move to the "New user slack message" and you will see the workflow page. There have been no runs yet.

Move to the "Test" page and input a valid test event, remember the workflow expects a name, email and paidPlan. You can copy this:

```json
{
  "name": "Rick Astley",
  "email": "nevergonn@giveyou.up",
  "paidPlan": true
}
```

Hit the "Run test" button and it will take us to our first run 🚀!

![Test a run](/images/run-test.png)

## 6. The run page

All of the steps in a workflow, including the initial event, can be viewed in detail. You will need to refresh the page if it's running to see it move between steps.

But there's a problem, we've used Slack in our code and we haven't authenticated.

![Test run failed](/images/run-failed.png)

## 7. Authenticating with Slack

When a workflow step uses an API integration that you haven't already authenticated with, it will pause until you've authenticated.

Simply click the "Connect to Slack" button and sign-in with your desired Slack workspace. As soon as you do, the workflow will pick up where it left off.

Test complete!

## 8. Triggering this workflow from code

As this workflow uses a custom event, we need to manually trigger it from our code. Anywhere in your code you can do this:

```ts
import { sendEvent } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

/*
...your other code
*/

await sendEvent({
  apiKey: "<my_api_key>",
  event: {
    name: "Eleven",
    email: "jane@hawksmoorhigh.edu",
    paidPlan: true,
  },
});
```

When you run your server and this code executes, it will trigger the workflow. You will see this in the run list on your workflow page.
