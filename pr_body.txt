## Summary
Fixes #2913

## Problem
GitHub Integration runs `trigger deploy` which executes `npm install` (or equivalent) in a Node 20 environment. If a project has strict `engines.node` requirements (e.g., "22"), the install phase fails before reaching the Docker build phase where the runtime config is respected.

## Fix
- Updated `updateTriggerPackages` in `packages/cli-v3/src/commands/update.ts` to accept an `ignoreEngines` option.
- Passed appropriate flags to `installDependencies` based on package manager:
  - npm: `--no-engine-strict`
  - pnpm: `--config.engine-strict=false`
  - yarn: `--ignore-engines`
- Updated `deploy.ts` to pass `ignoreEngines: true` when running package updates during deployment.

## Verification
- Added unit tests in `packages/cli-v3/src/commands/update.test.ts` to verify the correct flags are passed.
- Verified locally via unit tests.
