## @trigger.dev/database

This is the internal database package for the Trigger.dev project. It exports a generated prisma client that can be instantiated with a connection string.

### How to switch branches when you've done migrations

Sometimes you've applied migrations and then want to switch branches without wiping out your local database.

To do this you can run the following command:

```bash
DB_VOLUME=database-data-alt pnpm run docker
```

This will switch to the `alt` volume for your local database. This database will be blank if you haven't switched to this volume before, so you'll need to follow the normal steps (in the Contributing guide) to get setup, e.g. apply migrations and seed.

To switch back to the original volume, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run docker
```

### How to add a new index on a large table

1. Modify the Prisma.schema with a single index change (no other changes, just one index at a time)
2. Create a Prisma migration using `cd internal-packages/database && pnpm run db:migrate:dev --create-only`
3. Modify the SQL file: add IF NOT EXISTS to it and CONCURRENTLY:

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS "JobRun_eventId_idx" ON "JobRun" ("eventId");
```

4. Donâ€™t apply the Prisma migration locally yet. This is a good opportunity to test the flow.
5. Manually apply the index to your database, by running the index command.
6. Then locally run `pnpm run db:migrate:deploy`

#### Before deploying

Run the index creation before deploying

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS "JobRun_eventId_idx" ON "JobRun" ("eventId");
```

These commands are useful:

```sql
-- creates an index safely, this can take a long time (2 mins maybe)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS "JobRun_eventId_idx" ON "JobRun" ("eventId");
-- checks the status of an index
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index WHERE relid = '"JobRun"'::regclass;
-- checks if the index is there
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'JobRun' AND indexname = 'JobRun_eventId_idx';
```

Now, when you deploy and prisma runs the migration, it will skip the index creation because it already exists. If you don't do this, there will be pain.
