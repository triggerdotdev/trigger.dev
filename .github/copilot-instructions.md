This is the repo for Trigger.dev, a background jobs platform written in TypeScript. Our webapp at apps/webapp is a Remix 2.1 app that uses Node.js v20. Our SDK is an isomorphic TypeScript SDK at packages/trigger-sdk. Always prefer using isomorphic code like fetch, ReadableStream, etc. instead of Node.js specific code. Our tests are all vitest. We use prisma in internal-packages/database for our database interactions using PostgreSQL. For TypeScript, we usually use types over interfaces. We use zod a lot in packages/core and in the webapp. Avoid enums. Use strict mode. No default exports, use function declarations.
