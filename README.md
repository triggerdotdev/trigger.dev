# **‚ú® Trigger.dev**
### **The developer-first open source Zapier alternative.**


Trigger.dev is an open source platform that makes it easy for developers to create event-driven background tasks directly in their code. Build, test and run workflows locally using our SDK. Subscribe to webhooks, schedule jobs, run background jobs and add long delays easily and reliably. In our web app you get full visibility of every run your workflow has ever made making it easier to monitor and debug.

&nbsp;

# **‚≠êÔ∏è Features:**

- üëÇ Easily subscribe to [webhooks](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/webhooks)
  ‚Äî they work locally without tunnelling.
- üî• Fire your own [custom events](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/custom-events)‚Äîa single event can trigger multiple workflows.
- üìÜ [Schedule workflows](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/scheduled)‚Äîeasily repeat tasks or use CRON syntax for advanced cases.
- üö¶ Add [long delays](https://docs.trigger.dev/functions/delays) inside workflows (up to a year) and they will pick up where they left off.
- ü§ù When your server goes down [it‚Äôs not a problem](https://docs.trigger.dev/guides/resumability), workflows will reconnect and continue.
- ü™ß [View every step of every run](https://docs.trigger.dev/viewing-runs), with data, previews and errors.
- üëã Connect to and authenticate with APIs using our custom integrations.
- üöó If you have a custom use case, we support [Fetch for calling any HTTP endpoint](https://docs.trigger.dev/functions/fetch) or [webhooks](https://docs.trigger.dev/triggers/webhooks) for subscribing to events from APIs.
- üì° All API calls are automatically retried with exponential back off.
- üòÄ TypeScript SDK, so whether you‚Äôre using JavaScript or TypeScript you will have a great experience.

# üî¨ **Anatomy of a workflow**

* You create workflows in code on your server using our SDK
* Each API integration is a separate package, e.g. `@trigger.dev/slack`
* Each workflow has an event that triggers it, e.g. `github.events.newStarEvent`, `scheduleEvent`, `customEvent`
* Each workflow has a `run` function that is called when the event is triggered
* If we don't have an integration for the API you want to use, you can use `fetch` to call any HTTP endpoint and `webhookEvent` to subscribe to webhooks

## **Example workflows**

<details open><summary> Post to Slack when a GitHub repository is starred

_Integrations required: Slack, GitHub_

```ts
import { Trigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import * as github from "@trigger.dev/github";
import * as slack from "@trigger.dev/slack";

new Trigger({
  id: "new-github-star-to-slack",
  name: "New GitHub Star: triggerdotdev/trigger.dev",
  apiKey: "<my_api_key>",
  on: github.events.newStarEvent({
    repo: "triggerdotdev/trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (event) => {
    await slack.postMessage("github-stars", {
      channelName: "github-stars",
      text: `New GitHub star from \n<${event.sender.html_url}|${event.sender.login}>`,
    });

# üëÄ **Viewing runs:**

One of the most powerful features of Trigger.dev is the [runs page](https://docs.trigger.dev/viewing-runs). All of the steps in a workflow, including the initial event, can be viewed in detail. See the status / output of each step, the logs, rich previews, errors and much more.
