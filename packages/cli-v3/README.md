# Trigger.dev CLI

A CLI that allows you to create, run locally and deploy Trigger.dev background tasks.

Note: this only works with Trigger.dev v3 projects and later. For older projects use the [@trigger.dev/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trigger.dev/cli) package.

Trigger.dev is an open source platform that makes it easy to create event-driven background tasks directly in your existing project.
