  Task runs now have to signal checkpointable state prior to ALL checkpoints. This ensures flushing always happens.

  All important socket.io RPCs will now be retried with backoff. Actions relying on checkpoints will be replayed if we haven't been checkpointed and restored as expected, e.g. after reconnect.

  Other changes:

  - Fix retry check in shared queue
  - Fix env var sync spinner
  - Heartbeat between retries
  - Fix retry prep
  - Fix prod worker no tasks detection
  - Fail runs above `MAX_TASK_RUN_ATTEMPTS`

  - Upgrade socket.io-client to fix an ACK memleak
  - Additional index failure logs
  - Prevent message loss during reconnect
  - Prevent burst of heartbeats on reconnect
  - Prevent crash on failed cleanup
  - Handle at-least-once lazy execute message delivery
  - Handle uncaught entry point exceptions

- 9491a1649: Adds support for `emitDecoratorMetadata: true` and `experimentalDecorators: true` in your tsconfig using the [`@anatine/esbuild-decorators`](https://github.com/anatine/esbuildnx/tree/main/packages/esbuild-decorators) package. This allows you to use libraries like TypeORM:

  ```ts orm/index.ts
  import "reflect-metadata";
  import { DataSource } from "typeorm";
  import { Entity, Column, PrimaryColumn } from "typeorm";

  @Entity()
  export class Photo {
    @PrimaryColumn()
    id!: number;

    @Column()
    name!: string;

    @Column()
    description!: string;

    @Column()
    filename!: string;

    @Column()
    views!: number;

    @Column()
    isPublished!: boolean;
  }

  export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    username: "postgres",
    password: "postgres",
    database: "v3-catalog",
    entities: [Photo],
    synchronize: true,
    logging: false,
  });
  ```

  And then in your trigger.config.ts file you can initialize the datasource using the new `init` option:

  ```ts trigger.config.ts
  import type { TriggerConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
  import { AppDataSource } from "@/trigger/orm";

  export const config: TriggerConfig = {
    // ... other options here
    init: async (payload, { ctx }) => {
      await AppDataSource.initialize();
    },
  };
  ```

  Now you are ready to use this in your tasks:

  ```ts
  import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
  import { AppDataSource, Photo } from "./orm";

  export const taskThatUsesDecorators = task({
    id: "taskThatUsesDecorators",
    run: async (payload: { message: string }) => {
      console.log("Creating a photo...");

      const photo = new Photo();
      photo.id = 2;
      photo.name = "Me and Bears";
      photo.description = "I am near polar bears";
      photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg";
      photo.views = 1;
      photo.isPublished = true;

      await AppDataSource.manager.save(photo);
    },
  });
  ```

- 68d32429b: Capture and display stderr on index failures
- 374edef02: Updates the `trigger`, `batchTrigger` and their `*AndWait` variants to use the first parameter for the payload/items, and the second parameter for options.

  Before:

  ```ts
  await yourTask.trigger({ payload: { foo: "bar" }, options: { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" } });
  await yourTask.triggerAndWait({
    payload: { foo: "bar" },
    options: { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" },
  });

  await yourTask.batchTrigger({
    items: [{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }],
  });
  await yourTask.batchTriggerAndWait({
    items: [{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }],
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  await yourTask.trigger({ foo: "bar" }, { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" });
  await yourTask.triggerAndWait({ foo: "bar" }, { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" });

  await yourTask.batchTrigger([{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }]);
  await yourTask.batchTriggerAndWait([{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }]);
  ```

  We've also changed the API of the `triggerAndWait` result. Before, if the subtask that was triggered finished with an error, we would automatically "rethrow" the error in the parent task.

  Now instead we're returning a `TaskRunResult` object that allows you to discriminate between successful and failed runs in the subtask:

  Before:

  ```ts
  try {
    const result = await yourTask.triggerAndWait({ foo: "bar" });

    // result is the output of your task
    console.log("result", result);
  } catch (error) {
    // handle subtask errors here
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  const result = await yourTask.triggerAndWait({ foo: "bar" });

  if (result.ok) {
    console.log(`Run ${result.id} succeeded with output`, result.output);
  } else {
    console.log(`Run ${result.id} failed with error`, result.error);
  }
  ```

- e04d44866: v3: sanitize errors with null unicode characters in some places
- 26093896d: When using idempotency keys, triggerAndWait and batchTriggerAndWait will still work even if the existing runs have already been completed (or even partially completed, in the case of batchTriggerAndWait)

  - TaskRunExecutionResult.id is now the run friendlyId, not the attempt friendlyId
  - A single TaskRun can now have many batchItems, in the case of batchTriggerAndWait while using idempotency keys
  - A run’s idempotencyKey is now added to the ctx as well as the TaskEvent and displayed in the span view
  - When resolving batchTriggerAndWait, the runtimes no longer reject promises, leading to an error in the parent task

- 62c9a5b71: Fixes an issue that caused failed tasks when resuming after calling `triggerAndWait` or `batchTriggerAndWait` in prod/staging (this doesn't effect dev).

  The version of Node.js we use for deployed workers (latest 20) would crash with an out-of-memory error when the checkpoint was restored. This crash does not happen on Node 18x or Node21x, so we've decided to upgrade the worker version to Node.js21x, to mitigate this issue.

  You'll need to re-deploy to production to fix the issue.

## 3.0.0-beta.15

### Patch Changes

- 374edef02: Updates the `trigger`, `batchTrigger` and their `*AndWait` variants to use the first parameter for the payload/items, and the second parameter for options.

  Before:

  ```ts
  await yourTask.trigger({ payload: { foo: "bar" }, options: { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" } });
  await yourTask.triggerAndWait({
    payload: { foo: "bar" },
    options: { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" },
  });

  await yourTask.batchTrigger({
    items: [{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }],
  });
  await yourTask.batchTriggerAndWait({
    items: [{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }],
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  await yourTask.trigger({ foo: "bar" }, { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" });
  await yourTask.triggerAndWait({ foo: "bar" }, { idempotencyKey: "key_1234" });

  await yourTask.batchTrigger([{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }]);
  await yourTask.batchTriggerAndWait([{ payload: { foo: "bar" } }, { payload: { foo: "baz" } }]);
  ```

  We've also changed the API of the `triggerAndWait` result. Before, if the subtask that was triggered finished with an error, we would automatically "rethrow" the error in the parent task.

  Now instead we're returning a `TaskRunResult` object that allows you to discriminate between successful and failed runs in the subtask:

  Before:

  ```ts
  try {
    const result = await yourTask.triggerAndWait({ foo: "bar" });

    // result is the output of your task
    console.log("result", result);
  } catch (error) {
    // handle subtask errors here
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  const result = await yourTask.triggerAndWait({ foo: "bar" });

  if (result.ok) {
    console.log(`Run ${result.id} succeeded with output`, result.output);
  } else {
    console.log(`Run ${result.id} failed with error`, result.error);
  }
  ```

- 26093896d: When using idempotency keys, triggerAndWait and batchTriggerAndWait will still work even if the existing runs have already been completed (or even partially completed, in the case of batchTriggerAndWait)

  - TaskRunExecutionResult.id is now the run friendlyId, not the attempt friendlyId
  - A single TaskRun can now have many batchItems, in the case of batchTriggerAndWait while using idempotency keys
  - A run’s idempotencyKey is now added to the ctx as well as the TaskEvent and displayed in the span view
  - When resolving batchTriggerAndWait, the runtimes no longer reject promises, leading to an error in the parent task

- 62c9a5b71: Fixes an issue that caused failed tasks when resuming after calling `triggerAndWait` or `batchTriggerAndWait` in prod/staging (this doesn't effect dev).

  The version of Node.js we use for deployed workers (latest 20) would crash with an out-of-memory error when the checkpoint was restored. This crash does not happen on Node 18x or Node21x, so we've decided to upgrade the worker version to Node.js21x, to mitigate this issue.

  You'll need to re-deploy to production to fix the issue.
