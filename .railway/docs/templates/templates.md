# Templates

Let's talk templates!

Templates provide a way to jumpstart a project by giving users the means to package a service or set of services into a reusable and distributable format.

## Highlights

### Bootstrap Projects

Templates are the best way to bootstrap a project by enabling you to provision a service or set of services in a matter of clicks. Choose a template to deploy from the marketplace, or create your own from your personal scaffold.

### Best Practices

Creating templates can get complex, but these best practices will help you create templates that are easy to use and maintain.

### Community Clout

When you publish a template, it is placed into our template marketplace for all users of the Railway community to take advantage.

### [Kickback Program](/reference/templates#kickback-program)

Usage incurred by deployed templates from the marketplace are automatically eligible for a 50% kickback of the usage. In short, get paid for building templates!
