# Contributing to Trigger.dev

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Trigger.dev. Your involvement is not just welcomed, but we encourage it! ðŸš€

Please take some time to read this guide to understand contributing best practices for Trigger.dev.

Thank you for helping us make Trigger.dev even better! ðŸ¤©

## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. The changes on the `main`
branch are tagged into a release monthly.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version >=16.x
- [pnpm package manager](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 7
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository or [fork the repo](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/fork). If you plan to distribute the code, keep the source code public to comply with the [Apache Licence 2.0](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/blob/main/LICENSE).

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/trigger.dev.git
   ```

   > If you are on windows, run the following command on gitbash with admin privileges:
   > `git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/<github_username>/trigger.dev.git`

2. Navigate to the project folder
   ```
   cd trigger.dev
   ```
3. Install the required packages using pnpm.
   ```
   pnpm i
   ```
4. Create your `.env` file
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
5. Open it and generate a new value for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`:

   `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is used to two-way encrypt OAuth access tokens and so you'll probably want to actually generate a unique value, and it must be a random 16 byte hex string. You can generate one with the following command:

   ```sh
   openssl rand -hex 16
   ```

   Feel free to update `SESSION_SECRET` and `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET` as well using the same method.

6. Start Docker. This starts the required services like Postgres. If this is your first time using Docker, consider going through this [guide](DOCKER_INSTALLATION.md)
   ```
   pnpm run docker
   ```
7. Migrate the database
   ```
   pnpm run db:migrate
   ```
8. Build the app
   ```
   pnpm run build --filter webapp
   ```
9. Run the seed script
   ```
   pnpm run db:seed
   ```
10. Run the app. See the section below.

## Running

1. You can run the app with:

   ```
   pnpm run dev --filter webapp
   ```

   It should run on port `3030`: [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030/)

2. Once the app is running click the magic link button and enter your email.
3. Check your terminal, the magic link email should have printed out as following:

   ```sh
   webapp:dev: Log in to Trigger.dev
   webapp:dev:
   webapp:dev: Click here to log in with this magic link
   webapp:dev: [http://localhost:3030/magic?token=U2FsdGVkX18OvB0JxgaswTLCSbaRz%2FY82TN0EZWhSzFyZYwgG%2BIzKVTkeiaOtWfotPw7F8RwFzCHh53aBpMEu%2B%2B%2FItb%2FcJYh89MSjc3Pz92bevoEjqxSQ%2Ff%2BZbks09JOpqlBbYC3FzGWC8vuSVFBlxqLXxteSDLthZSUaC%2BS2LaA%2BJgp%2BLO7hgjAaC2lXbCHrM7MTgTdXOFt7i0Dvvuwz6%2BWY25RnfomZOPqDsyH0xz8Q2rzPTz0Xu53WSXrZ1hd]
   webapp:dev:
   webapp:dev: If you didn't try to log in, you can safely ignore this email.
   ```

   Paste the magic link shown in your terminal into your browser to login.

## Adding and running migrations

1. Modify packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma file
2. Change directory to the packages/database folder
   ```sh
   cd packages/database
   ```
3. Generate the Prisma client

   ```sh
   pnpm run generate
   ```

   The above updates the prisma client generated into node_modules/.prisma/client folder. This helps with typing of relevant prisma models. It ensures typescript
   recognizes fields added or removed from a model and type-checks appropriately.

4. Create and apply the migrations

   ```
   pnpm run db:migrate:dev
   ```

   This creates a migration file and executes the migrations against your database and applies changes to the database schema(s)

5. Commit generated migrations as well as changes to the schema.prisma file
6. If you're using VSCode you may need to restart the Typescript server in the webapp to get updated type inference. Open a TypeScript file, then open the Command Palette (View > Command Palette) and run `TypeScript: Restart TS server`.

## Testing CLI changes

To test CLI changes, follow the steps below:

1. Build the CLI and watch for changes

```sh
cd packages/cli
pnpm run dev
```

2. Open a new Terminal window and run the webapp locally and then create a new project in the dashboard. Copy out the dev API key.

3. Create a new temporary Next.js app in examples directory

```sh
cd ./examples
pnpm create next-app@latest test-cli --ts --no-eslint --tailwind --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

4. Then once that's finished, add the `@trigger.dev/cli` to the `devDependencies` of the newly created Next.js app's `package.json` file, like so:

```json
{
  // other package.json properties
  "devDependencies": { "@trigger.dev/cli": "workspace:*" }
}
```

5. Back in the terminal, navigate into the example, and initialize the CLI. When prompted, select `self-hosted` and enter `localhost:3030` if you are testing against the local instance of Trigger.dev, or you can just use the Trigger.dev cloud. When asked for an API key, use the key you copied earlier.

```sh
cd ./test-cli
pnpm i
pnpm exec trigger-cli init
```

6. If you are just testing the `init` command, you can stop here. If you'd like to test the `dev` command, first start the Next.js app on port 3000:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

7. Open a new terminal window, and then run the `dev` command like so:

```sh
pnpm exec trigger-cli dev
```

8. Please remember to delete the temporary project you created after you've tested the changes, and before you raise a PR.

## Running end-to-end webapp tests

To run the end-to-end tests, follow the steps below:

1. Set up environment variables (copy example envs into the correct place)

```sh
cp ./.env.example ./.env
cp ./examples/nextjs-test/.env.example ./examples/nextjs-test/.env.local
```

2. Set up dependencies

```sh
# Build packages
pnpm run build --filter @examples/nextjs-test^...
pnpm --filter @trigger.dev/database generate

# Move trigger-cli bin to correct place
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Install playwrite browsers (ONE TIME ONLY)
npx playwright install
```

3. Set up the database

```sh
pnpm run docker
pnpm run db:migrate
pnpm run db:seed
```

4. Run the end-to-end tests

```sh
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### Cleanup

The end-to-end tests use a `setup` and `teardown` script to seed the database with test data. If the test runner doesn't exit cleanly, then the database can be left in a state where the tests can't run because the `setup` script will try to create data that already exists. If this happens, you can manually delete the `users` and `organizations` from the database using prisma studio:

```sh
# With the database running (i.e. pnpm run docker)
pnpm run db:studio
```

## Add sample jobs

The [examples/jobs-starter](./examples/jobs-starter/) project defines simple jobs you can get started with.

1. `cd` into `examples/jobs-starter`
2. Create a `.env.local` file with the following content,
   replacing `[TRIGGER_DEV_API_KEY]` with an actual key:

```env
TRIGGER_API_KEY=[TRIGGER_DEV_API_KEY]
TRIGGER_API_URL=http://localhost:3030
```

`TRIGGER_API_URL` is used to configure the URL for your Trigger.dev instance,
where the jobs will be registered.

3. Run the `jobs-starter` app:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

4. Navigate to your trigger.dev instance ([http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030/)), to see the jobs.
   You can use the test feature to trigger them.

## Making a pull request

**If you get errors, be sure to fix them before committing.**

- Be sure to [check the "Allow edits from maintainers" option](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) while creating you PR.
- If your PR refers to or fixes an issue, be sure to add `refs #XXX` or `fixes #XXX` to the PR description. Replacing `XXX` with the respective issue number. See more about [Linking a pull request to an issue
  ](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- Be sure to fill the PR Template accordingly.

## Adding changesets

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage our package versions and changelogs. If you've never used changesets before, first read [their guide here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md).

If you are contributing a change to any packages in this monorepo (anything in either the `/packages` or `/integrations` directories), then you will need to add a changeset to your Pull Requests before they can be merged.

To add a changeset, run the following command in the root of the repo

```sh
pnpm run changeset:add
```

Here's an example of creating a `patch` changeset for the `@trigger.dev/github` and `@trigger.dev/slack` packages (click to view):

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/599228.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/599228)

You will be prompted to select which packages to include in the changeset. Only select the packages that you have made changes for.

Most of the time the changes you'll make are likely to be categorized as patch releases. If you feel like there is the need for a minor or major release of the package based on the changes being made, add the changeset as such and it will be discussed during PR review.

## Troubleshooting

### EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3030

When receiving the following error message:

```sh
webapp:dev: Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3030
```

The process running on port `3030` should be destroyed.

1. Get the `PID` of the process running on PORT `3030`
   ```sh
   lsof -i :3030
   ```
2. Kill the process
   ```sh
   sudo kill -9 <PID>
   ```
