## What gets bundled?

We automatically bundle everything for your tasks. This includes:

- Your tasks (they can be in any file inside a /trigger folder, they just need to be exported with a name).
- Imported npm packages.
- Other imports from your code.

Mostly this means you shouldn't need to think about what gets bundled. Just write your tasks and we'll take care of the rest. If you need to alter the bundling you use the [trigger.config file](/v3/trigger-config).

## Multiple `/trigger` folders

You can have multiple `/trigger` folders in your repository.

- Each `/trigger` folder can have many tasks exported from it.
- Each file inside a `/trigger` folder can export many tasks.

### (Optional) configuration

It is possible to manually set one or more folders as `/trigger` folders in your [trigger.config file](/v3/trigger-config).
