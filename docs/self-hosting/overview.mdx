description: "You can self-host Trigger.dev on your own infrastructure."
---

Self-hosting Trigger.dev means you run and manage the platform on your own infrastructure, giving you full control over your environment, deployment process, and the URLs you expose the service on.

You are responsible for provisioning resources, handling updates, and managing any security, scaling or reliability challenges that arise.

We provide version-tagged releases for self-hosted deployments. It's highly advised to use these tags exclusively and keep them locked with your CLI version.

## Should you self-host?

Trigger.dev Cloud is fully managed, scalable, and comes with dedicated support. For most users, it offers the best experience. However, if you have specific requirements around data residency, compliance, or infrastructure control, self-hosting may be the right choice for you.

The self-hosted version is functionally the same as Trigger.dev Cloud with [some exceptions](#feature-comparison), but our managed Cloud infrastructure is designed for high availability, security, and scale.

Because we don't manage self-hosted instances, we cannot guarantee how Trigger.dev will perform on your infrastructure. You assume all responsibility and risk for your deployment, including security, uptime, and data integrity.

For more details, carry on reading and follow our guides for instructions on setting up a self-hosted Trigger.dev instance. If you prefer a managed experience, you can [sign up](https://cloud.trigger.dev/login) for our Cloud offering instead - we have a generous [free tier](https://trigger.dev/pricing) for you to try it out.

| Preview branches  | ❌           | 100M            |

### Machine overrides

You can override the machine type for a task by setting the `MACHINE_PRESETS_OVERRIDE_PATH` environment variable to a JSON file with the following structure.

```json
{
  "defaultMachine": "small-1x",
  "machines": {
    "micro": { "cpu": 0.25, "memory": 0.25 },
    "small-1x": { "cpu": 0.5, "memory": 0.5 },
    "small-2x": { "cpu": 1, "memory": 1 }
    // ...etc
  }
}
```

All fields are optional. Partial overrides are supported:

```json
{
  "defaultMachine": "small-2x",
  "machines": {
    "small-1x": { "memory": 2 }
  }
}
```
