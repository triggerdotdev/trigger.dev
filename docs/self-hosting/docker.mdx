## Introduction

This guide will use docker compose to spin up a Trigger.dev instance. Make sure to read the [overview](/self-hosting/overview) first.

We've split the compose files into Webapp and Worker components so you can easily run them independently. This will also allow you to scale your workers as needed.

**Warning:** This guide alone is unlikely to result in a production-ready deployment. Security, scaling, and reliability concerns are not fully addressed here.
