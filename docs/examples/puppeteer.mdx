## Overview

There are 2 example tasks to follow on this page:

1. [Generate a PDF](/examples/puppeteer#generate-a-pdf)
2. [Scrape data from a website](/examples/puppeteer#scrape-data-from-a-website)

<Warning>
  **WEB SCRAPING WARNING:** Direct scraping of third-party websites without explicit permission using Trigger.dev Cloud is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate account suspension. If web scraping is necessary for your project, you MUST use a proxy service to comply with our terms of service.
</Warning>

## Adding build configurations

To use all examples on this page, you'll first need to add these build settings to your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts trigger.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    // This is required to use the Puppeteer library
    external: ["puppeteer"],
  },
});
```

<Note>
  Any packages that install or build a native binary should be added to external, as native binaries
  cannot be bundled.
</Note>
