## Overview

This example shows how to set up a webhook handler for incoming Stripe events. The handler triggers a task when a `checkout.session.completed` event is received. This is easily customisable to handle other Stripe events.

## Key features

- Shows how to create a Stripe webhook handler
- Triggers a task when a `checkout.session.completed` event is received

## Environment variables

You'll need to configure the following environment variables for this example to work:

- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` The secret key used to verify the Stripe webhook signature.
- `TRIGGER_API_URL` Your Trigger.dev API url: `https://api.trigger.dev`
- `TRIGGER_API_SECRET` Your Trigger.dev API secret.

## Setting up the Stripe webhook handler

First you'll need to create a [Stripe webhook](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) handler route that listens for POST requests and verifies the Stripe signature.

Here are examples of how you can set up a handler using different frameworks:

<CodeGroup>

```ts Next.js
// app/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import Stripe from "stripe";
import type { stripeCheckoutCompleted } from "@/trigger/stripe-checkout-completed";
//     ðŸ‘† **type-only** import

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const signature = request.headers.get("stripe-signature");
  const payload = await request.text();

  if (!signature || !payload) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Invalid Stripe payload/signature" },
      {
        status: 400,
      }
    );
  }

  const event = Stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    payload,
    signature,
    process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET as string
  );

  // Perform the check based on the event type
  switch (event.type) {
    case "checkout.session.completed": {
      // Trigger the task only if the event type is "checkout.session.completed"
      const { id } = await tasks.trigger<typeof stripeCheckoutCompleted>(
        "stripe-checkout-completed",
        event
      );
      return NextResponse.json({ runId: id });
    }
    default: {
      // Return a response indicating that the event is not handled
      return NextResponse.json(
        { message: "Event not handled" },
        {
          status: 200,
        }
      );
    }
  }
}
```

```ts Remix
// app/webhooks/stripe.ts
import { type ActionFunctionArgs, json } from "@remix-run/node";
import type { stripeCheckoutCompleted } from "src/trigger/stripe-webhook";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import Stripe from "stripe";

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  // Validate the Stripe webhook payload
  const signature = request.headers.get("stripe-signature");
  const payload = await request.text();

  if (!signature || !payload) {
    return json({ error: "Invalid Stripe payload/signature" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const event = Stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    payload,
    signature,
    process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET as string
  );

  // Perform the check based on the event type
  switch (event.type) {
    case "checkout.session.completed": {
      // Trigger the task only if the event type is "checkout.session.completed"
      const { id } = await tasks.trigger<typeof stripeCheckoutCompleted>(
        "stripe-checkout-completed",
        event
      );
      return json({ runId: id });
    }
    default: {
      // Return a response indicating that the event is not handled
      return json({ message: "Event not handled" }, { status: 200 });
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Task code

This task is triggered when a `checkout.session.completed` event is received from Stripe.

```ts trigger/stripe-webhook.ts
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import type stripe from "stripe";

export const stripeCheckoutCompleted = task({
  id: "stripe-checkout-completed",
  run: async (payload: stripe.Event, {}) => {
    // Add your custom logic for handling the checkout.session.completed event here
  },
});
```

## Testing your task locally

To test everything is working you can use the Stripe CLI to send test events to your endpoint:

1. Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install), and login
2. Follow the instructions to [test your handler](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook). This will include a temporary `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` that you can use for testing.
3. If your endpoint is set up correctly, you should see the Stripe events logged in your console with a status of `200`.
4. Then, check the [Trigger.dev](https://cloud.trigger.dev) dashboard and you should see the successful run of the `stripe-webhook` task.

For more information on setting up and testing Stripe webhooks, refer to the [Stripe Webhook Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks).
