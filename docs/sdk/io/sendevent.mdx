title: "io.sendEvent()"
sidebarTitle: "sendEvent()"
description: "`io.sendEvent()` allows you to send an event from inside a Job run. The sent even will trigger any Jobs that are listening for that event (based on the name)."
---

If you want to send an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you should use [client.sendEvent()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent) instead.

Use [eventTrigger()](/sdk/eventtrigger) on a Job to listen for events.

## Parameters

<Snippet file="stable-key-param.mdx" />

<ResponseField name="seconds" type="number" required>
  The number of seconds to wait. This can be very long, serverless timeouts are
  not an issue.
</ResponseField>

```typescript Send an event
//this Job sends an event that triggers the second job
new Job(client, {
  id: "job-1",
  name: "First job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: cronTrigger({
    cron: "0 9 * * *", // 9am every day (UTC)
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    //sends the "new.user" event with a userId in the payload
    await io.sendEvent("send-event", {
      name: "new.user",
      payload: {
        userId: "u_1234567890",
      },
    });
  },
});

new Job(client, {
  id: "job-2",
  name: "Second job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  //subscribes to the "new.user" event
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "new.user",
    schema: z.object({

    }),
  }),
