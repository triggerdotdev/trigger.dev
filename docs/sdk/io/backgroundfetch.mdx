sidebarTitle: "backgroundFetch()"
description: "`io.backgroundFetch()` allows you to fetch data from a URL that can take longer that the serverless timeout. The actual `fetch` request is performed on the Trigger.dev platform, and the response is sent back to you. An example use case is fetching data from a slow API, like some AI endpoints."
---

This is used inside the OpenAI Integration for Tasks like `backgroundCreateChatCompletion` and `backgroundCreateCompletion`.

## Parameters

<Snippet file="stable-key-param.mdx" />
<ResponseField name="url" type="string" required>
  The url to fetch.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="options" type="object">
  Options for the request

<Expandable title="options" defaultOpen>
  <ResponseField name="method" type="string">
    The HTTP method to use for the request.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="headers" type="object">
    Any headers to send with the request. Note that you can use
    [redactString](sdk/redactString) to prevent sensitive information from being
    stored (e.g. in the logs), like API keys and tokens.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="body" type="string | ArrayBuffer">
    The body of the request.
  </ResponseField>
</Expandable>

<ResponseField name="retry options" type="object">
  An object where the key is a status code pattern and the value is a retrying strategy. Supported patterns are:
  - Specific status codes: 429
  - Ranges: 500-599
  - Wildcards: 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx

```ts
  {
      "500-599": {
        strategy: "backoff",
        limit: 5,
        minTimeoutInMs: 1000,
        maxTimeoutInMs: 30000,
        factor: 1.8,
        randomize: true,
      },
      "429": {
        strategy: "backoff",
        limit: 10,
        minTimeoutInMs: 1000,
        maxTimeoutInMs: 60000,
        factor: 2,
        randomize: true,
      },
    }
```

An individual retrying strategy can be one of two types:

- `backoff`: Retries the request with an exponential backoff.
- `headers`: Retries the request using info from the response headers.

<Expandable title="backoff strategy">
  <ResponseField name="type" type="backoff" required>
    The `backoff` strategy retries the request with an exponential backoff.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="limit" type="number">
    The maximum number of times to retry the request.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="minTimeoutInMs" type="number">
    The minimum amount of time to wait before retrying the request.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="maxTimeoutInMs" type="number">
    The maximum amount of time to wait before retrying the request.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="factor" type="number">
    The exponential factor to use when calculating the next retry time.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="randomize" type="boolean">
    Whether to randomize the retry time.
  </ResponseField>
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="headers strategy">
  <ResponseField name="type" type="headers" required>
    The `headers` strategy retries the request using info from the response
    headers.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="limitHeader" type="string">
    The header to use to determine the maximum number of times to retry the
    request.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="remainingHeader" type="string">
    The header to use to determine the number of remaining retries.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="resetHeader" type="string">
    The header to use to determine the time when the number of remaining retries
    will be reset.
  </ResponseField>
</Expandable>

</ResponseField>

</ResponseField>

## Returns

A `Promise` that resolves after the specified amount of time.
