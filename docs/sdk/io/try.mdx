title: "io.try()"
sidebarTitle: "try()"
description: "`io.try()` allows you to run Tasks and catch any errors that are thrown, it's similar to a normal `try/catch` block but works with [io.runTask()](/sdk/io/runtask)."
---

A regular `try/catch` block on its own won't work as expected with Tasks. Internally `runTask()` throws some special errors to control flow execution. This is necessary to deal with resumability, serverless timeouts, and retrying Tasks.

## How to `catch` errors inside `run()`

You have two options:

1. Use the `io.try()` function documented on this page.
2. Use a regular `try/catch` block and [isTriggerError](/sdk/isTriggerError) to check if the error is a special error type.

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="tryCallback" required>
  The code you wish to run
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="catchCallback" required>
  This will be called if the Task fails. The callback receives the error
</ResponseField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="return" required>
  A Promise that resolves with the returned value or the error
</ResponseField>

```typescript Using io.try()
new Job(client, {
  id: "get-repo-info",
  name: "GitHub get repo info",
  version: "0.1.0",
  integrations: { github },
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "repo.info",
    schema: z.object({
      owner: z.string(),
      repo: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    //try
    const result = io.try(
      async () => {
        const repo = await io.github.getRepo("get-repo", {
          owner: payload.owner,
          repo: payload.repo,
        });

        return {
          success: true as const,
          repo,
        };
      },
      async (error) => {
        //you can return data from the error handler,
        //if you wish to elegantly deal with errors
        return {
          success: false as const,
          error,
        };
      }
    );

    //result is either
    // { success: true, repo: Repo }
    // or
    // { success: false, error: Error }

    return result;
  },
});
