title: "io.runTask()"
sidebarTitle: "runTask()"
description: "`io.runTask()` allows you to run a [Task](/documentation/concepts/tasks) from inside a Job run."
---

A Task is a resumable unit of a Run that can be retried, resumed and is logged. [Integrations](/integrations) use Tasks internally to perform their actions.

The wrappers at `io.integration.runTask()` expose the underlying Integration client as the first callback parameter (see examples on the right). They will have defaults set for options and `onError` handlers, but should otherwise be considered identical to raw `io.runTask()`.

## Parameters

<Snippet file="stable-key-param.mdx" />

<ResponseField name="callback" type="function" required>
  The callback that will be called when the Task is run, this is where your logic should go. The callback receives
  the Task and the IO as parameters.

  <Expandable title="arguments">

{" "}

<ResponseField name="params" type="any">
  The input params to the Task, will be displayed in the logs.

      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>

  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="callback" type="object">
    An optional object that exposes settings for the remote callback feature.

    Enabling this feature will expose a `callbackUrl` property on the callback's Task parameter. Additionally, `io.runTask()` will now return a Promise that resolves with the body of the first request sent to that URL.

    <Expandable title="property fields">
      <ResponseField name="enabled" type="boolean" required>
        Whether to enable the remote callback feature.
      </ResponseField>
      <ResponseField name="timeoutInSeconds" type="number" required>

      </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
  </ResponseField>

</Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="onError" type="function">
  An optional callback that will be called when the Task fails. You can perform
  logic in here and optionally return a custom error object. Returning an object with `{ retryAt: Date, error?: Error }` will retry the Task at the specified Date. You can also just return a new `Error` object to throw a new error. Return nothing to rethrow the original error.

  <Expandable title="arguments">
    <ResponseField name="error" type="unknown">
      The underlying error that was thrown inside the Task callback.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="task" type="Task">
      The Task that failed.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Returns

A Promise that resolves with the returned value of the callback.

If the remote callback feature `options.callback` is enabled, the Promise will instead resolve with the body of the first request sent to `task.callbackUrl`.
