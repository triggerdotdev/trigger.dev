title: "isTriggerError()"
description: "Use this function if you're using a `try/catch` block to catch errors."
---

A regular `try/catch` block on its own won't work as expected with Tasks. Internally `runTask()` throws some special errors to control flow execution. This is necessary to deal with resumability, serverless timeouts, and retrying Tasks.

If this function returns `true` you must rethrow the error. If it returns `false` you can handle the error as you normally would.

## How to `catch` errors inside `run()`

You have two options:

1. Use a regular `try/catch` block and `isTriggerError()` as documented on this page.
2. Use the [io.try()](/sdk/io/try) function.

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="error" required>
  The error to check.
</ResponseField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="boolean" required>
  `true` if the error is a Trigger Error, `false` otherwise.

You must rethrow the error if this function returns `true`.

</ResponseField>

```typescript Using io.try()
new Job(client, {
  id: "get-repo-info",
  name: "GitHub get repo info",
  version: "0.1.0",
  integrations: { github },
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "repo.info",
    schema: z.object({
      owner: z.string(),
      repo: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    //try
    try {
      return await io.github.getRepo("get-repo", {
        owner: payload.owner,
        repo: payload.repo,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      //if it is a TriggerError you must rethrow the error
      if (isTriggerError(error)) {
        throw error;
      }

      //do whatever you want when an error occurs
      return {
        success: false as const,
        error,
      };
    }
  },
});
```
