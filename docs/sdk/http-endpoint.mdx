title: "HttpEndpoint"
description: "`HttpEndpoint` allows you to create and HttpTrigger, which means you can trigger your Jobs from any webhooks"
---

There are two steps to using an `HttpEndpoint`:

1. Use [client.defineHttpEndpoint()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/define-http-endpoint) to create an `HttpEndpoint`.
2. Use onRequest() to create an `HttpTrigger`. This method is shown below.

You can see a complete example on this page.

## Creating an HttpEndpoint

Use [client.defineHttpEndpoint()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/define-http-endpoint) to create an `HttpEndpoint`.

## Methods

### onRequest()

You don't need to provide any options to `onRequest()`. But you can provide a filter â€“ if an incoming request matches the filter then the Job will run.

```typescript
const caldotcom = client.defineHttpEndpoint({
  //this should be unique inside your project
  id: "cal.com",
  //usually you'd use the domain name of the service
  source: "cal.com",
  //the icon is optional, it displays in the dashboard
  icon: "caldotcom",
  //this function is called when a webhook is received
  verify: async (request) => {
    //this is a useful helper function that can verify sha256 signatures
    //each API has a different header name
    return await verifyRequestSignature({
      request,
      //you can find the header name in the API's documentation
      headerName: "X-Cal-Signature-256",
      //you can find the secret in the Trigger.dev dashboard, on the HTTP endpoint page
      secret: process.env.CALDOTCOM_SECRET!,
      algorithm: "sha256",
    });
  },
});

client.defineJob({
  id: "http-caldotcom",
  name: "HTTP Cal.com",
  version: "1.0.0",
  enabled: true,
  //this create a Trigger using the caldotcom endpoint
  trigger: caldotcom.onRequest(),
  run: async (request, io, ctx) => {
    //note that when using HTTP endpoints, the first parameter is the request
    //you need to get the body, usually it will be json so you do:
    const body = await request.json();
    await io.logger.info(`Body`, body);
  },
});
```
