title: "intervalTrigger()"
description: "`intervalTrigger()` is set as a [Job's trigger](/sdk/job) to trigger a Job at a recurring interval."

## Development

<Snippet file="scheduled-dev-warning.mdx" />

## Defining an interval

Intervals are set with a number of seconds. There are some important considerations:

- The Job will first run the specified number of seconds after it has first connected to an [Environment](/documentation/concepts/environments-endpoints). This will happen when you first [deploy](/documentation/guides/deployment) that Job.
- The minimum interval is 60 seconds (any input less than this it will default to 60).
- The maximum interval is 2_592_000 seconds (30 days), if you pass more than this it will trigger every 30 days.

If you wish to Run a Job at an exact time or less frequently than once pr day you should use a [cronTrigger()](/sdk/crontrigger) instead.
