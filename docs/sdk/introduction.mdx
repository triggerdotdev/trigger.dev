| [TriggerClient](/sdk/triggerclient)       | TriggerClient is used to create a client that connects to the Trigger.dev platform                                                                       |

| [eventTrigger()](/sdk/eventtrigger)       | `eventTrigger()` is set as a [Job's trigger](/sdk/job) to subscribe to an event a Job from [a sent event](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent). |
| [cronTrigger()](/sdk/crontrigger)         | `cronTrigger()` is set as a [Job's trigger](/sdk/job) to trigger a Job on a recurring schedule using a CRON expression.                                  |
| [intervalTrigger()](/sdk/intervaltrigger) | `intervalTrigger()` is set as a [Job's trigger](/sdk/job) to trigger a Job at a recurring interval.                                                      |
| [DynamicTrigger](/sdk/dynamictrigger)     | `DynamicTrigger` allows you to define a trigger that can be configured dynamically at runtime.                                                           |
