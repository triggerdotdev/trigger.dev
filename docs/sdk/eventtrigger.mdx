You can have multiple Jobs that subscribe to the same event, they will all trigger when the event gets delivered.

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="options" defaultOpen>
    <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
      The name of the event you are subscribing to. Must be an exact match (case
      sensitive).
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="schema" type="object">
      A [Zod](/documentation/guides/zod) schema that defines the shape of the
      event payload. The default is `z.any()` which is `any`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="source" type="string">
      You can use this to filter events based on the source.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="filter" type="object">
      Used to filter which events trigger the Job.

      An example:

      ```typescript
      {
        name: ["John", "Jane"],
        age: [18, 21]
      }
      ```

      This filter would match against an event with the following data:

      ```json
      {
        "name": "Jane",
        "age": 18,
        "location": "San Francisco"
      }
      ```

    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="examples" type="array">
