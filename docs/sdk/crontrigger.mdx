## CRON expressions

CRON expressions are strings that define when something should happen.

Some examples:

- `"0 0 * * *"`: will run the Job every day at 12:00am UTC.
- `"30 14 * * 1"`: will run the Job every Monday at 2:30pm UTC.

A useful tool when writing CRON expressions is [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru).

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="options" defaultOpen>
    <ResponseField name="cron" type="string" required>
      A CRON expression that defines the schedule. Note that the timezone used
      is always UTC.
    </ResponseField>
