description: "Job is used to create and configure a Job"

A [Job](/documentation/concepts/jobs) is used to define the [Trigger](/documentation/concepts/triggers), metadata, and what happens when it runs.

You can define a job in one of two ways, using the `new Job` constructor or by using the `TriggerClient.defineJob` instance method.

<RequestExample>

```ts constructor
new Job(client, {
  id: "slack-kpi-summary",
  name: "Slack kpi summary",
  version: "0.1.1",
  integrations: {
    slack,
  },
  trigger: cronTrigger({
    cron: "0 9 * * *", // 9am every day (UTC)
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const { revenue } = await db.getKpiSummary(payload.ts);
    const response = await io.slack.postMessage("Slack 📝", {
      text: `Yesterday's revenue was $${revenue}`,
      channel: "C04GWUTDC3W",
    });

    return response;
  },
});
```

```ts client.defineJob
client.defineJob({
  id: "github-integration-on-issue",
  name: "GitHub Integration - On Issue",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: github.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssue,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "empty",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("This is a simple log info message");
    return { payload, ctx };
  },
});
```

```ts queue options
client.defineJob({
  id: "github-integration-on-issue",
  name: "GitHub Integration - On Issue",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: github.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssue,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "empty",
  }),
  queue: {
    name: "my-queue",
    maxConcurrent: 10, // only 10 runs can happen at the same time
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.logger.info("This is a simple log info message");
    return { payload, ctx };
  },
});
```

# Constructor

## Parameters

<ParamField body="client" type="object" required>
  An instance of [TriggerClient](/sdk/triggerclient) that is used to send events to the Trigger API.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
      The `id` property is used to uniquely identify the Job. Only change this if you want to create a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
      The `name` of the Job that you want to appear in the dashboard and logs. You can change this without creating a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="version" type="string" required>
      The `version` property is used to version your Job. A new version will be created if you change this property. We recommend using [semantic versioning](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semantic-versioning), e.g. `1.0.3`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="trigger" type="object" required>
      The `trigger` property is used to define when the Job should run. There are currently the following Trigger types:
      - [cronTrigger](/sdk/crontrigger)
      - [intervalTrigger](/sdk/intervaltrigger)
      - [eventTrigger](/sdk/eventtrigger)
      - [DynamicTrigger](/sdk/dynamictrigger)
      - [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule)
      - integration Triggers, like webhooks. See the [integrations](/integrations) page for more information.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="run" type="function" required>
      This function gets called automatically when a Run is Triggered. It has three parameters:
      1. `payload` – The payload that was sent to the Trigger API.
      2. [io](/sdk/io) – An object that contains the integrations that you specified in the `integrations` property and other useful functions like delays and running Tasks.
      3. [context](/sdk/context) – An object that contains information about the Organization, Job, Run and more.

      This is where you put the code you want to run for a Job. You can use normal code in here and you can also use Tasks.

      You can return a value from this function and it will be sent back to the Trigger API.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="integrations" type="object">
      Imports the specified integrations into the Job. The integrations will be available on the `io` object in the `run()` function with the same name as the key. For example:
      <Snippet file="how-to-pass-integrations.mdx" />
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="enabled" type="boolean">
      The `enabled` property is used to enable or disable the Job. If you disable a Job, it will not run.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="queue" type="string | QueueOptions">
      The `queue` property is used to specify a custom queue. If you use an Object and specify the `maxConcurrent` option, you can control how many simulataneous runs can happen.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="logLevel" type="log | error | warn | info | debug">
      The `logLevel` property is an optional property that specifies the level of
      logging for the Job. The level is inherited from the client if you omit this property.
      - `log` - logs only essential messages
      - `error` - logs error messages
      - `warn` - logs errors and warning messages
      - `info` - logs errors, warnings and info messages
      - `debug` - logs everything with full verbosity
    </ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="Job instance" type="Job" />
