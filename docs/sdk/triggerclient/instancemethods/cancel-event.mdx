If you've scheduled an event to be delivered in the future, you can cancel it using the `cancelEvent()` instance method, passing in the ID of the event you want to cancel. This will prevent any jobs listening for that event from being triggered.

```ts
// Sending an event that will be delivered in 24 hours
const event = await client.sendEvent(
  {
    id: "event_12345",
    name: "my.event",
    payload: {
      foo: "bar",
    },
  },
  {
    deliverAt: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24), // deliver in 24 hours
  }
);

// Sometime later, cancel the event by ID
await client.cancelEvent(event.id);
```

<Note>
  Cancelling an event after it has already triggered a job run does not cancel the job run.
  Cancelling events only prevent the event from triggering future job runs.
