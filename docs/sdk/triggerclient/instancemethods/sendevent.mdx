description: "The `sendEvent()` instance method send an event that triggers any Jobs that are listening for that event (based on the name)."

You can call this function from anywhere in your code to send an event. The other way to send an event is by using [io.sendEvent()](/sdk/io/sendevent) from inside a `run()` function.

Use [eventTrigger()](/sdk/eventtrigger) on a Job to listen for events.

  },
});
```

```ts Send an event with an ID
const event = client.sendEvent({
  id: "e_1234567890", // You can use this to deduplicate events

  payload: {
    userId: "u_1234567890",
  },
});
```

```ts Send an event to be delivered later
const event = client.sendEvent(
  {
    id: "e_1234567890", // You can use this to deduplicate events
    name: "new.user",
    payload: {
      userId: "u_1234567890",
