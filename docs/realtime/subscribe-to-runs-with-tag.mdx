import RunObject from "/snippets/realtime/run-object.mdx";

<RequestExample>

```ts Example
import { runs } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

for await (const run of runs.subscribeToRunsWithTag("user:1234")) {
  console.log(run);
}
```

</RequestExample>

This function subscribes to all changes to runs with a specific tag. It returns an async iterator that yields the run object whenever a run with the specified tag is updated. This iterator will never complete, so you must manually break out of the loop when you no longer want to receive updates.

### Authentication

This function supports both server-side and client-side authentication. For server-side authentication, use your API key. For client-side authentication, you must generate a public access token with one of the following scopes:

- `read:runs`
- `read:tags:<tagName>`

To generate a public access token, use the `auth.createPublicToken` function:

```ts
import { auth } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

// Somewhere in your backend code
const publicToken = await auth.createPublicToken({
  scopes: {
    read: {
      tags: ["user:1234"],
    },
  },
});
```

### Response

The AsyncIterator yields an object with the following properties:

<RunObject />
