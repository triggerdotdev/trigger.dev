The [run object](/realtime/run-object#the-run-object) is the main object returned by Realtime subscriptions (e.g., `runs.subscribeToRun()`). It contains all the information about the run, including the run ID, task identifier, payload, output, and more.

Type-safety is supported for the run object, so you can infer the types of the run's payload and output. See [type-safety](#type-safety) for more information.

## Type-safety

You can infer the types of the run's payload and output by passing the type of the task to the `subscribeToRun` function. This will give you type-safe access to the run's payload and output.

```ts
import { runs, tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import type { myTask } from "./trigger/my-task";

// Somewhere in your backend code
async function myBackend() {
  const handle = await tasks.trigger("my-task", { some: "data" });

  for await (const run of runs.subscribeToRun<typeof myTask>(handle.id)) {
    // This will log the run every time it changes
    console.log(run.payload.some);

    if (run.output) {
      // This will log the output if it exists
      console.log(run.output.some);
    }
  }
}
```

When using `subscribeToRunsWithTag`, you can pass a union of task types for all the possible tasks that can have the tag.

```ts
import { runs } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import type { myTask, myOtherTask } from "./trigger/my-task";

// Somewhere in your backend code
for await (const run of runs.subscribeToRunsWithTag<typeof myTask | typeof myOtherTask>("my-tag")) {
  // You can narrow down the type based on the taskIdentifier
  switch (run.taskIdentifier) {
    case "my-task": {
      console.log("Run output:", run.output.foo); // This will be type-safe
      break;
    }
    case "my-other-task": {
      console.log("Run output:", run.output.bar); // This will be type-safe
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

This works with all realtime subscription functions:

- `runs.subscribeToRun<TaskType>()`
- `runs.subscribeToRunsWithTag<TaskType>()`
- `runs.subscribeToBatch<TaskType>()`
