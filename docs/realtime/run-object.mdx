## Type safety

You can get type safety for the run's payload and output by passing your task type to subscription functions:

```ts
import { runs } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import type { myTask } from "./trigger/my-task";

for await (const run of runs.subscribeToRun<typeof myTask>(runId)) {
  // run.payload and run.output are now typed based on your task
  console.log(run.payload.someProperty); // Type-safe

  if (run.output) {
    console.log(run.output.result); // Type-safe
  }
}
```

This works with all realtime subscription functions:

- `runs.subscribeToRun<TaskType>()`
- `runs.subscribeToRunsWithTag<TaskType>()`
- `runs.subscribeToBatch<TaskType>()`
