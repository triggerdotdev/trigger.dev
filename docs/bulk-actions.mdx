Bulk actions allow you to perform operations like replaying or canceling on multiple runs at once. This is especially useful when you need to retry a batch of failed runs with a new version of your code, or when you need to cancel multiple in-progress runs.

## Bulk replaying

You can replay multiple runs at once by selecting them from the table on the Runs page using the checkbox on the left hand side of the row. Then click the "Replay runs" button from the bulk action bar that appears at the bottom of the screen.

This is especially useful if you have lots of failed runs and want to run them all again. To do this, first filter the runs by the status you want, then select all the runs you want to replay and click the "Replay runs" button from the bulk action bar at the bottom of the page.

## Bulk canceling

Similar to replaying multiple runs, you can cancel multiple runs at once. This is particularly useful when you have a batch of runs that you want to stop, perhaps because they were triggered with incorrect parameters or are no longer needed.

To cancel multiple runs:

1. Filter the runs table to show the runs you want to cancel (e.g., all runs with status "QUEUED" or "EXECUTING")
2. Use the checkboxes on the left side of the runs table to select the runs you want to cancel 
3. Click the "Cancel runs" button in the bulk action bar that appears at the bottom of the screen

After confirming, all selected runs that can be canceled (those in appropriate states like QUEUED or EXECUTING) will be canceled. The status of these runs will change to "CANCELED" and they will not be resumed.

<Note>
  You can only cancel runs that are in states that allow cancellation (like QUEUED or EXECUTING).
  Runs that are already completed, failed, or in other final states cannot be canceled.
