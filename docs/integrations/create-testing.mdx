# examples/job-catalog

When building an official integration (in the Trigger.dev monorepo) you should use the job-catalog to test your integration. This collection of examples is useful for creating docs as well as testing.

## 1. Getting setup

You can follow [the README](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/tree/main/examples/job-catalog) to get setup. It explains how to add a new Job as well.

## 2. Adding your package

You'll need to add your integration to [the package.json file](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/blob/main/examples/job-catalog/package.json):

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@trigger.dev/mynewapi": "workspace:*",
  }
  ...
}
```

And to [the tsconfig.json file](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/blob/main/examples/job-catalog/tsconfig.json):

```json
{
  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "paths": {
      ...
      "@trigger.dev/mynewapi": [
        "../../integrations/mynewapi/src/index"
      ],
      "@trigger.dev/mynewapi/*": [
        "../../integrations/mynewapi/src/*"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Adding your Jobs

Create a new file in `src` that uses all the features of your integration. [The Typeform one](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/blob/main/examples/job-catalog/src/typeform.ts) is a useful reference that has Tasks and Triggers.
