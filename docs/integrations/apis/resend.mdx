## Overview

Resend is the email API for developers. With our Resend integration you can send email campaigns, transactional emails, and automated emails (drip campaigns) from your app.

## Installing the Resend packages

To get started with our Resend integration, you need to install the `@trigger.dev/resend` packages. You can do this using `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/resend@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/resend@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/resend@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

Resend supports API Keys. Official documentation [here](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/api-keys/create-api-key).

```ts
import { Resend } from "@trigger.dev/resend";

const resend = new Resend({
  id: "resend",
  apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Tasks

Once you have set up a Resend client, you can use it to create tasks.
