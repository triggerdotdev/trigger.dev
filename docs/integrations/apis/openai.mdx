title: Introduction

Trigger.dev provides seamless integration with OpenAI, enabling developers to harness the power of AI
language models in their serverless applications. With Trigger.dev's background tasks, long-running
OpenAI completions become possible, even within the constraints of serverless timeouts.

## Installation

To get started with the OpenAI integration on Trigger.dev, you need to install the `@trigger.dev/openai` package.
You can do this using npm, pnpm, or yarn:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/openai@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

To use the OpenAI API with Trigger.dev, you'll need an API Key from OpenAI.
If you don't have one yet, you can obtain it from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "@trigger.dev/openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  id: "openai",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Usage

Include the OpenAI integration in your Trigger.dev job:

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // Now you can access the OpenAI tasks through the io object
    await io.openai.createCompletion("completion", {
      model: "davinci",
      prompt: "Once upon a time",
    });
  },
});
```

## Tasks

Tasks that are marked as "long-running" can last longer than your serverless timeout – they are performed on one of our background workers.

## Examples

### Generate a joke

Here's an example of how to use the OpenAI integration in a Trigger.dev job.
In this example, we'll create a background task to generate a programming joke.

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion("background-chat-completion", {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: "Create a good programming joke about background jobs",
        },
      ],
    });

    await io.logger.info("choices", response.choices);
  },
});
```

### Generate Code Snippets

In this example, we'll leverage Trigger.dev's background task to generate code snippets for
a given programming task:

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const programmingTask = `Create a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.`;

    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateCompletion("background-completion", {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      prompt: `Coding task: ${programmingTask}\n\n`,
    });

    await io.logger.info("codeSnippet", response.choices[0]?.text);
  },
});
```

### Summarize Text

We'll use Trigger.dev's background task to summarize a lengthy article:

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const articleToSummarize = `Lorem ipsum. olor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
    Sed nec aliquet sapien. Pellentesque vitae nisi id purus luctus tincidunt. 
    Proin condimentum malesuada turpis, eget tincidunt mauris viverra in.`;

    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateCompletion("background-completion", {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      prompt: `Please summarize the following article:\n\n${articleToSummarize}`,
    });

    await io.logger.info("summary", response.choices[0]?.text);
  },
});
```

### Draft Email Response

we'll use Trigger.dev's background task to draft an email response based on a given email content:

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "openai-tasks",
  name: "OpenAI Tasks",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.tasks",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const emailContent = `Dear John,

    Thank you for your inquiry. We appreciate your interest in our products.
    I have reviewed your request, and I'm pleased to inform you that we can
    accommodate your requirements. Please find the attached proposal for your
    reference. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

    Best regards,
    Jane Doe`;

    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion("background-chat-completion", {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [
        {
          role: "user",
          content: emailContent,
        },
        {
          role: "assistant",
          content: "Draft a suitable response to the email above.",
        },
      ],
    });

    await io.logger.info("draftedEmailResponse", response.choices[0]?.text);
  },
});
```

### Chatbot Counseling Session

This job represents a simulated AI counseling session. Leveraging OpenAI's ability to understand context and generate human-like text, it forms empathetic responses to user inputs. Such a system could be part of a mental wellness app.

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "openai-chatbot-counseling",
  name: "Chatbot Counseling Session",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.startCounselingSession",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion(
      "background-counseling-chat-completion",
      {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "system",
            content: "You are a helpful and empathetic AI counselor.",
          },
          {
            role: "user",
            content: "I've been feeling really stressed out lately.",
          },
        ],
      }
    );
    await io.logger.info("counseling session", response.choices);
  },
});
```

### AI Roleplay Game Session

This job creates a fantasy AI role-playing game. It could be fun for interactive storytelling or game development contexts.

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "openai-roleplay-game-session",
  name: "AI Roleplay Game Session",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "openai.startRoleplayGameSession",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }),
  integrations: {
    openai,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    const response = await io.openai.backgroundCreateChatCompletion(
      "background-roleplay-game-session-chat-completion",
      {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "system",
            content: "You are an intelligent guide in a fantasy role-playing game.",
          },
          {
            role: "user",
            content: "I embark on a quest for the enchanted crown. What's the first step?",
          },
        ],
      }
    );
    await io.logger.info("roleplay game session", response.choices);
  },
});
```
