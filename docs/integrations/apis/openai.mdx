## Overview

Trigger.dev has a seamless integration with OpenAI, enabling developers to harness the power of AI
language models in their serverless applications. With Trigger.dev's background tasks, long-running
OpenAI completions become possible, even within the constraints of serverless timeouts.

## Authentication

To use the OpenAI API with Trigger.dev, you'll need an API Key from OpenAI.
If you don't have one yet, you can obtain it from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```ts
import { OpenAI } from "@trigger.dev/openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  id: "openai",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Tasks

Once you have set up a OpenAI client, you can use it to create tasks.
