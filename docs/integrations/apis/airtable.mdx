## Overview

Our Airtable integration allows you to easily connect to the Airtable API and perform tasks such as creating / updating / deleting single or multiple records in your tables.

For examples of some of the things you can do with it, check out our Jobs Showcase:

## Installation

To get started with the Airtable integration on Trigger.dev, you need to install the `@trigger.dev/airtable` package.
You can do this using npm, pnpm, or yarn:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/airtable@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @trigger.dev/airtable@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/airtable@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

To use the Airtable API with Trigger.dev, you can either use OAuth or a Personal Access Token.

### OAuth

To use OAuth you can connect to Airtable via the Trigger.dev [web app](https://cloud.trigger.dev). Click 'Integrations' in the side panel of any project, and configure Airtable with the ID you want to use in your job and the required [scopes](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes).

```ts
import { Airtable } from "@trigger.dev/airtable";

//this will use OAuth
const airtable = new Airtable({
  id: "airtable",
});
```

### Personal Access Token

You can create an Airtable Personal Access Token [here on their developer site](https://airtable.com/create/tokens).

```ts
import { Airtable } from "@trigger.dev/airtable";

//this will use the passed in token (defined in your environment variables)
const airtable = new Airtable({
  id: "airtable",
  token: process.env["AIRTABLE_TOKEN"],
});
```

## Tasks

Once you have set up a Airtable client, you can use it to create tasks.
