## Usage

Our Supabase package supports two different integrations: One for the Supabase Management API and one that wraps the `@supabase/supabase-js` client.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Management API" icon="server" href="/integrations/apis/supabase/management">
    The [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction) is used to manage
    your Supabase organization, projects, and databases. It can also be used to trigger jobs based
    on changes in your Supabase database. Works with OAuth or Personal Access Tokens.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Supabase Client" icon="database" href="/integrations/apis/supabase/client">
    Wraps the [@supabase/supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js) client to make it
    easy to use Supabase in your jobs to run queries against your database and access other
    functionality, like auth, storage, and functions. Works with your Supabase
    [service_role](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys#the-servicerole-key) key.
