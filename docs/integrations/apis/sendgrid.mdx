## Overview

SendGrid is a cloud-based SMTP provider that allows you to send email without having to maintain email servers. With our SendGrid integration you can send email campaigns, transactional emails, and automated emails (drip campaigns) from your app.

## Installing the SendGrid packages

To get started with our SendGrid integration, you need to install the `@trigger.dev/sendgrid` packages. You can do this using `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @trigger.dev/sendgrid@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/sendgrid@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/sendgrid@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

SendGrid supports API Keys. Official documentation [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys).

```ts
import { SendGrid } from "@trigger.dev/sendgrid";

const sendgrid = new SendGrid({
  id: "sendgrid",
  apiKey: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!,
});
```

## Tasks

Once you have set up a SendGrid client, you can use it to create tasks.
