Tasks are executed after the job is triggered and are the main building blocks of a job. You can string together as many tasks as you want.

## All tasks

### `sendEmail`

Send an email to a recipient with a text payload. [Official Resend Docs](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email)

```ts example.ts
  // Using the 'io.resend.sendEmail' method to send an email using the Resend service.
  await io.resend.sendEmail("send-email", {
    to: <recipient-email-address>, // Recipient's email address.
    subject: <email-subject>, // Email subject.
    text: <email-body>, // Plain text content of the email.
    from: "Your-Name <your-email-address>", // Sender's email address and name.
  });
}
```

## Example usage

In this example we'll create a task that sends a basic email built using React & Typescript to a 'to' email address with a 'subject', a 'text' field and a 'from' email address.
Here we use [Zod](/documentation/guides/zod), a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

```ts example.ts
// Importing necessary modules and packages.
import { TriggerClient, eventTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { Resend } from "@trigger.dev/resend";
import { z } from "zod";

// Importing React and React Email components for creating styled emails.
import { Html } from "@react-email/html";
import { Head } from "@react-email/head";
import { Text } from "@react-email/text";
import { Button } from "@react-email/button";
import { Section } from "@react-email/section";
import { Preview } from "@react-email/preview";
import { Container } from "@react-email/container";

// Creating an instance of the TriggerClient with a unique identifier "jobs-showcase."
const client = new TriggerClient({ id: "jobs-showcase" });

// Creating an instance of the Resend client with an API key obtained from an environment variable.
const resend = new Resend({
  id: "resend",
  apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!,
});

// Defining styles for the email's HTML components.
const container = {
  width: "480px",
  margin: "0 auto",
  padding: "20px 0 48px",
};

const title = {
  fontSize: "24px",
  lineHeight: 1.25,
};

const section = {
  padding: "24px",
  border: "solid 1px #dedede",
  borderRadius: "5px",
  textAlign: "center" as const,
};

const text = {
  margin: "0 0 10px 0",
  textAlign: "left" as const,
};

const button = {
  fontSize: "14px",
  font: "bold",
  backgroundColor: "#28a745",
  color: "#fff",
  lineHeight: 1.5,
  borderRadius: "0.2em",
  textAlign: "center" as const,
};

// React component for creating a styled email.
function BasicEmail({ name, text }: { name: string; text: string }) {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <Preview>Welcome to Acme Inc!</Preview>
      <Container style={container}>
        <Section style={section}>
          <Text>Hey {name}!</Text>
          <Text>{text}</Text>
          <Button style={button} pY={4} pX={4} href="https://acmecompany.inc/">
            Get started
          </Button>
        </Section>
      </Container>
    </Html>
  );
}

// Defining a job that sends a basic email built using React and Typescript.
client.defineJob({
  id: "resend-send-react-email", // Unique identifier for the job.
  name: "Resend: send react email", // A specific name for the job.
  version: "1.0.0", // Version number for the job.
  trigger: eventTrigger({ //triggering an event to send email
    name: "send.email",
    schema: z.object({ //initiating the Zod schema
      to: z.string(),  //Storing EmailTo as a string in the Zod Object
      subject: z.string(), //Storing Subject as a string in the Zod Object
      text: z.string(), //Storing EmailBodyText as a string in the Zod Object
      name: z.string(), //Storing Name as a string in the Zod Object
      from: z.string(), //Storing EmailFrom as a string in the Zod Object
    }),
  }),
  integrations: {
    resend, // Integrating the Resend client into this job.
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // Inside the 'run' function, an email is sent using the Resend service.

    await io.resend.sendEmail("send-email", {
      to: payload.to,
      subject: payload.subject,
      text: payload.text,
      from: payload.from,
      react: <BasicEmail name={payload.name} text={payload.text} />,
    });
  },
});

// If you're not using Express, you can remove these lines.
import { createExpressServer } from "@trigger.dev/express";
createExpressServer(client);
```
