Tasks are executed after the job is triggered and are the main building blocks of a job. You can string together as many tasks as you want.

## All tasks

### `sendEmail`

Send an email to a recipient with a text payload. [Official Resend Docs](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email)

```ts example.ts
  // Using the 'io.resend.sendEmail' method to send an email using Resend.
  await io.resend.sendEmail("send-email", {
    to: <recipient-email-address>, // Recipient's email address.
    subject: <email-subject>, // Email subject.
    text: <email-body>, // Plain text content of the email.
    from: "Your-Name <your-email-address>", // Sender's email address and name.
  });
}
```

## Example

In this example we use [Zod](/documentation/guides/zod), a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

```ts
import { Resend } from "@trigger.dev/resend";
import { Job, eventTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { z } from "zod";

...

const resend = new Resend({
  id: "resend",
  apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY!,
});

client.defineJob({
  id: "send-resend-email",
  name: "Send Resend Email",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "send.email",
    schema: z.object({
      to: z.union([z.string(), z.array(z.string())]),
      subject: z.string(),
      text: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  integrations: {
    resend,
  },
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    await io.resend.emails.send("send-email", {
      to: payload.to,
      subject: payload.subject,
      text: payload.text,
      from: "Trigger.dev <hello@email.trigger.dev>",
    });
  },
});
```
