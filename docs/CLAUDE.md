# Mintlify documentation

Our docs are written using Mintlify. Please refer to the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt) to write amazing Mintlify style docs, especially their components. Make sure to use their components where possible, especially for documenting parameters and responses using their ParamField, ResponseField, Expandable, etc. Use CodeGroup when you want to show multiple code editors side by side. Use Callout when you want to call out important information. Accordions are great for showing more detail but without the need to scroll. The Step component is great for showing a list of steps.There are also Tabs, Tooltips, etc.

## Working relationship

- You can push back on ideas-this can lead to better documentation. Cite sources and explain your reasoning when you do so
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information

## Project context

- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings
- Components: Mintlify components

## Content strategy

- Document just enough for user success - not too much, not too little
- Prioritize accuracy and usability of information
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Search for existing information before adding new content. Avoid duplication unless it is done for a strategic reason
- Check existing patterns for consistency
- Start by making the smallest reasonable changes

## docs.json

- Refer to the [docs.json schema](https://mintlify.com/docs.json) when building the docs.json file and site navigation

## Frontmatter requirements for pages

- title: Clear, descriptive page title
- description: Concise summary for SEO/navigation

## Writing standards

- Second-person voice ("you")
- Prerequisites at start of procedural content
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Match style and formatting of existing pages
- Include both basic and advanced use cases
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Relative paths for internal links

## Git workflow

- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Ask how to handle uncommitted changes before starting
- Create a new branch when no clear branch exists for changes
- Commit frequently throughout development
- NEVER skip or disable pre-commit hooks

## Do not

- Skip frontmatter on any MDX file
- Use absolute URLs for internal links
- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions - always ask for clarification
