This example sends a reminder email to a user at the specified datetime.

```ts /trigger/reminder-email.ts
export const sendReminderEmail = task({
  id: "send-reminder-email",
  run: async (payload: { to: string; name: string; date: string }) => {
    //wait until the date
    await wait.until({ date: new Date(payload.date) });

    //todo send email
    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: "hello@trigger.dev",
      to: payload.to,
      subject: "Don't forgetâ€¦",
      html: `<p>Hello ${payload.name},</p><p>...</p>`,
    });
  },
});
```

This allows you to write linear code without having to worry about the complexity of scheduling or managing cron jobs.

## `throwIfInThePast`

You can optionally throw an error if the date is already in the past when the function is called:

```ts
await wait.until({ date: new Date(date), throwIfInThePast: true });
```

You can of course use try/catch if you want to do something special in this case.
