## What is Trigger.dev?

Trigger.dev is an open source background jobs framework that lets you write reliable workflows in plain async code. Run long-running AI tasks, handle complex background jobs, and build AI agents with built-in queuing, automatic retries, and real-time monitoring. No timeouts, elastic scaling, and zero infrastructure management required.

We provide everything you need to build and manage background tasks: a CLI and SDK for writing tasks in your existing codebase, support for both [regular](/tasks/overview) and [scheduled](/tasks/scheduled) tasks, full observability through our dashboard, and a [Realtime API](/realtime) with [React hooks](/frontend/react-hooks#realtime-hooks) for showing task status in your frontend. You can use [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev) or [self-host](/open-source-self-hosting) on your own infrastructure.
