## Getting the run cost and duration

You can get the cost and duration of the current including retries of the same run.

```ts
export const heavyTask = task({
  id: "heavy-task",
  machine: {
    preset: "medium-2x",
  },
  run: async (payload, { ctx }) => {
    // Do some compute
    const result = await convertVideo(payload.videoUrl);

    // Get the current cost and duration up until this line of code
    // This includes the compute time of the previous lines
    let currentUsage = usage.getCurrent();
    /* currentUsage = {
        compute: {
          attempt: {
            costInCents: 0.01700,
            durationMs: 1000,
          },
          total: {
            costInCents: 0.0255,
            durationMs: 1500,
          },
        },
        baseCostInCents: 0.0025,
        totalCostInCents: 0.028,
      } 
      */

    // In the cloud product we do not count waits towards the compute cost or duration.
    // We also don't include time between attempts or before the run starts executing your code.
    // So this line does not affect the cost or duration.
    await wait.for({ seconds: 5 });

    // This will give the same result as before the wait.
    currentUsage = usage.getCurrent();

    // Do more compute
    const result = await convertVideo(payload.videoUrl);

    // This would give a different value
    currentUsage = usage.getCurrent();
  },
});
```

<Note>
  In Trigger.dev cloud we do not include time between attempts, before your code executes, or waits
  towards the compute cost or duration.

## Getting the run cost and duration from your backend

You can use [runs.retrieve()](/management/runs/retrieve) to get a single run or [runs.list()](/management/runs/list) to get a list of runs. The response will include `costInCents` `baseCostInCents` and `durationMs` fields.

```ts single run
import { runs } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

const run = await runs.retrieve("run-id");
console.log(run.costInCents, run.baseCostInCents, run.durationMs);
const totalCost = run.costInCents + run.baseCostInCents;
```

```ts multiple runs
import { runs } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

let totalCost = 0;
for await (const run of runs.list({ tag: "user_123456" })) {
  totalCost += run.costInCents + run.baseCostInCents;
  console.log(run.costInCents, run.baseCostInCents, run.durationMs);
}

console.log("Total cost", totalCost);
```

## Getting the cost and duration of a block of code

You can also wrap code with `usage.measure` to get the cost and duration of that block of code:

```ts
// Inside a task run function, or inside a function that's called from there.
const { result, compute } = await usage.measure(async () => {
  //...Do something for 1 second
  return {
    foo: "bar",
  };
});

logger.info("Result", { result, compute });
/* result = {
    foo: "bar"
  }
  compute = {
    costInCents: 0.01700,
    durationMs: 1000,
  }
*/
```

This will work from inside the `run` function, our lifecycle hooks (like `onStart`, `onFailure`, `onSuccess`, etc.), or any function you're calling from the `run` function. It won't work for code that's not executed using Trigger.dev.
