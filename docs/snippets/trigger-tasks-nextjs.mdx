Run your Next.js app:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Run the dev server from Step 2. of the [Initial Setup](/guides/frameworks/nextjs#initial-setup) section above if it's not already running:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Now visit the URL in your browser to trigger the task. Ensure the port number is the same as the one you're running your Next.js app on. For example, if you're running your Next.js app on port 3000, visit:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/api/hello-world
    ```

    You should see the CLI log the task run with a link to view the logs in the dashboard.
