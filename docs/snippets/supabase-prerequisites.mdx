<Step title="Optional step 1: create a new Supabase project">

<Info> If you already have a Supabase project on your local machine you can skip this step.</Info>

You can create a new project by running the following command in your terminal using the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase init
```

<Note>
  If you are using VS Code, ensure to answer 'y' when asked to generate VS Code settings for Deno,
  and install any recommended extensions.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Optional step 2: create package.json and tsconfig.json files">

If your project does not already have `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` files (e.g. if you are using Deno), create them manually and add them to your project root folder.

<Info> If your project has these files you can skip this step.</Info>

Both of these files are required for the Trigger.dev SDK to work correctly.

```ts package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Update the import path to use the version of the SDK you are using. E.g. "@trigger.dev/sdk": "3.0.0-beta.55"
    "@trigger.dev/sdk": "<your-sdk-version>"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Update the import path to use the version of typescript you are using
    "typescript": "^5.5.4"
  }
}
```

```ts tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "noEmit": true
  },
  "include": ["./src/**/*.ts", "trigger.config.ts"]
}
```

After you have created these files, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

</Step>
