<Step title="Optional step 1: create a new Supabase project">

<Info> If you already have a Supabase project on your local machine you can skip this step.</Info>

You can create a new project by running the following command in your terminal using the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase init
```

<Note>
  If you are using VS Code, ensure to answer 'y' when asked to generate VS Code settings for Deno,
  and install any recommended extensions.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Optional step 2: create a package.json file">

If your project does not already have `package.json` file (e.g. if you are using Deno), create it manually in your project's root folder.

<Info> If your project has a `package.json` file you can skip this step.</Info>

This is required for the Trigger.dev SDK to work correctly.

```ts package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.6.2"
  }
}
```

<Note> Update your Typescript version to the latest version available. </Note>
