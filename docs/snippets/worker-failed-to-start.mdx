### Worker failed to start when running Dev command

An issue may occur when trying to run the development command for Trigger.dev when using certain packages like `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` or ORMs like Drizzle ORM. The error message typically indicates that there's a problem with importing ES modules in a CommonJS context.

```bash Error message
X Error: Worker failed to start Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module [...] not supported.
Instead change the require of index.js in [...] to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.
```

This issue is related to how Trigger.dev bundles code and interacts with certain ES module dependencies.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. In your `trigger.config.ts` file, add the problematic dependencies to the `dependenciesToBundle` array:

```bash trigger.config.ts
export const config: TriggerConfig = {
  // ... other config options
  dependenciesToBundle: [
    /@t3-oss/,
    "drizzle-orm",
    /@neondatabase/,
    // Add other problematic dependencies here
  ],
};
```

2. If you're using environment variables with `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`, implement a `resolveEnvVars` function in your config file:

```bash trigger.config.ts
import { env } from "@/env";
import type { ResolveEnvironmentVariablesFunction } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const resolveEnvVars: ResolveEnvironmentVariablesFunction = () => {
  return {
    variables: Object.keys(env).map((key) => ({
      name: key,
      value: env[key as keyof typeof env]?.toString(),
    })),
  };
};
```

3. For users of packages that require WebSocket (like `@neondatabase/serverless`), you may need to set up a WebSocket polyfill if you're using Node.js versions earlier than 22. Add this to your code:

```bash
import { neonConfig, Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import ws from 'ws';

neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;
```
