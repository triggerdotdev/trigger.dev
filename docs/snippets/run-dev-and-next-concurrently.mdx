<Tip>
  Instead of running your Next.js app and Trigger.dev dev server in separate terminals, you can run them concurrently. First, add these scripts to your `package.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "trigger:dev": "npx trigger.dev@latest dev",
      "dev": "npx concurrently --kill-others --names \"next,trigger\" --prefix-colors \"yellow,blue\" \"next dev\" \"npm run trigger:dev\""
    }
  }
  ```

  Then, in your terminal, you can start both servers with a single command:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This will run both your Next.js app and Trigger.dev dev server in the same terminal window, with color-coded output to distinguish between them.
