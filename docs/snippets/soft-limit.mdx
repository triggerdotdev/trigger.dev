<Accordion title="How to increase these limits?">
  These are soft-limits and can be increased. Before we introduce paid plans in July you can request
  more [on Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) or by [contacting us](https://trigger.dev/contact).
  If you increase these defaults you may have to subscribe to a paid plan when we introduce them.
  For more details on the v3 Cloud pricing see the [pricing
  details](https://trigger.dev/blog/v3-developer-preview-launch#cloud-pricing).
