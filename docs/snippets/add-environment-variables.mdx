## Manually add your environment variables (optional)

If you have any environment variables in your tasks, be sure to add them in the dashboard so deployed code runs successfully. In Node.js, these environment variables are accessed in your code using `process.env.MY_ENV_VAR`.

In the sidebar select the "Environment Variables" page, then press the "New environment variable"
button. ![Environment variables page](/images/environment-variables-page.jpg)

You can add values for your local dev environment, staging and prod. ![Environment variables

You can also add environment variables in code by following the steps on the [Environment Variables page](/deploy-environment-variables#in-your-code).
