<Step title="Run the CLI `init` command">

The easiest way to get started it to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing project, create a `/trigger` folder and give you an example task.

Run this command in the root of your project to get started:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@beta init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@beta init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@beta init
```

</CodeGroup>

It will do a few things:

1. Log you into the CLI if you're not already logged in.
2. Create a `trigger.config.ts` file in the root of your project.
3. Ask where you'd like to create the `/trigger` directory.
4. Create the `/trigger` directory with an example task, `/trigger/example.[ts/js]`.

Install the "Hello World" example task when prompted. We'll use this task to test the setup.
