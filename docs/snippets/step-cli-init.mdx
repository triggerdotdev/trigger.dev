<Step title="Run the CLI `init` command">

The easiest way to get started is to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing project, create a `/trigger` folder and give you an example task.

Run this command in the root of your project to get started:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>


It will do a few things:

<Tip title="MCP Server">
  Our [Trigger.dev MCP server](/mcp-introduction) gives your AI assistant direct access to Trigger.dev tools; search docs, trigger tasks, deploy projects, and monitor runs. We recommend installing it for the best developer experience.
</Tip>

1. Ask if you want to install the [Trigger.dev MCP server](/mcp-introduction) for your AI assistant.
2. Log you into the CLI if you're not already logged in.
3. Ask you to select your project.
4. Install the required SDK packages.
5. Ask where you'd like to create the `/trigger` directory and create it with an example task.
6. Create a `trigger.config.ts` file in the root of your project.

Install the "Hello World" example task when prompted. We'll use this task to test the setup.
