<Step title="Run the CLI `init` command">

Run this command in the root of your project:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>

You'll be asked to choose how to initialize:

- **Trigger.dev MCP** Installs our [MCP server](/mcp-overview) into your AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), then lets your AI assistant set up the project for you.
- **CLI** — Continue with the traditional CLI setup.

<Note> The Trigger.dev [MCP](/mcp-overview) lets AI assistants search our up-to-date docs, create and manage projects, trigger and deploy tasks, and monitor runs across environments. If you use AI coding assistants this will give you the best developer experience.</Note>

If you choose CLI, it will:

1. Log you into the CLI if you're not already logged in.
2. Create a `trigger.config.ts` file in the root of your project.
3. Ask where you'd like to create the `/trigger` directory.
4. Create the `/trigger` directory with an example task, `/trigger/example.[ts/js]`.

Install the "Hello World" example task when prompted. We'll use this task to test the setup.
