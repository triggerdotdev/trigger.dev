Run the command like this:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  This will fail in CI if any version mismatches are detected. Ensure everything runs locally first
  using the [dev](/cli-dev-commands) command and don't bypass the version checks!
</Warning>

It performs a few steps to deploy:

1. Optionally updates packages when running locally.
2. Compiles and bundles the code.
3. Deploys the code to the Trigger.dev instance.
4. Registers the tasks as a new version in the environment (prod by default).

## Deploying from CI

When deploying from CI/CD environments such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins, you need to authenticate non-interactively by setting the `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable. Please see the [CI / GitHub Actions guide](/github-actions) for more information.

## Arguments

```
npx trigger.dev@latest deploy [path]
```

<ProjectPathArg />

## Options

<ConfigFileOption />

<ProjectRefOption />

<EnvFileOption />

<SkipUpdateCheckOption />

<ParamField body="Environment" type="--env | -e">
  Defaults to `prod` but you can specify `staging` or `preview`. If you specify `preview` we will
  try and automatically detect the branch name from git.
</ParamField>

<BranchOption />

<ParamField body="Dry run" type="--dry-run">
  Create a deployable build but don't deploy it. Prints out the build path so you can inspect it.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Skip promotion" type="--skip-promotion">
  Skips automatically promoting the newly deployed version to the "current" deploy.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Skip syncing env vars" type="--skip-sync-env-vars">
  Turn off syncing environment variables with the Trigger.dev instance.
</ParamField>

### Common options

These options are available on most commands.

### Self-hosting

When [self-hosting](/open-source-self-hosting), builds are performed locally by default. Set the `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable and point to your self-hosted instance using `TRIGGER_API_URL` or `--api-url`:

```bash
TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token TRIGGER_API_URL=https://your-trigger-instance.com npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

For CI/CD setup with self-hosting, see the [GitHub Actions guide](/github-actions#self-hosting).

<ParamField body="Local build" type="--local-build">
  Force building the deployment image locally using your local Docker. This is automatic when self-hosting.
</ParamField>
