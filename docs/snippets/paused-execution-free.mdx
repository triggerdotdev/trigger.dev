In the Trigger.dev Cloud we automatically pause execution of tasks when they are waiting for
longer than a few seconds.

When triggering and waiting for subtasks, the parent is checkpointed and while waiting does not count towards compute usage. When waiting for a time period (`wait.for` or `wait.until`), if the wait is longer than 5 seconds we checkpoint and it does not count towards compute usage.
