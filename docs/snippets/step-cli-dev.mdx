<Step title="Run the CLI `dev` command">

The CLI `dev` command runs a server for your tasks. It watches for changes in your `/trigger` directory and communicates with the Trigger.dev platform to register your tasks, perform runs, and send data back and forth.

It can also update your `@trigger.dev/*` packages to prevent version mismatches and failed deploys. You will always be prompted first.
