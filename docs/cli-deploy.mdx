import ComingSoon from '/snippets/coming-soon-generic.mdx';

You run the command like this:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@beta deploy
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@beta deploy
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@beta deploy
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>Will fail in CI if any version mismatches are detected. Ensure everything runs locally first using the [dev](/cli-dev) command and don't bypass the version checks!</Warning>

It performs a few steps to deploy:

1. Optionally updates packages when running locally.
2. Typechecks the code.
3. Compiles and bundles the code.
4. Checks that [environment variables](/deploy-environment-variables) are set.
5. Deploys the code to the cloud.
6. Registers the tasks as a new version in the environment (prod by default).

## Options

### Environment `--env` or `-e`

Defaults to `prod` but you can specify `staging`.

### Skip typecheck `--skip-typecheck` or `-T`

#### Self-hosted (builds locally) `--self-hosted`
