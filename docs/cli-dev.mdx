This runs a server on your machine that can execute Trigger.dev tasks:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@beta dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@beta dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@beta dev
```

</CodeGroup>

It will first perform an update check to prevent version mismatches, failed deploys, and other errors. You will always be prompted first.

You will see in the terminal that the server is running and listening for requests. When you run a task, you will see it in the terminal along with a link to view it in the dashboard.

It is worth noting that each task runs in a separate Node process. This means that if you have a long-running task, it will not block other tasks from running.

## Options

### Attaching a local debugger

You can use the `--debugger` flag to run the server in debug mode. This will allow you to attach a debugger to the server and debug your tasks.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@beta dev --debugger
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@beta dev --debugger
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@beta dev --debugger
```

</CodeGroup>
