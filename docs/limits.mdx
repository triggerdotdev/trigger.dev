## Concurrency limits

| Pricing tier | Limit                |
| :----------- | :------------------- |
| Free         | 10 concurrent runs   |
| Hobby        | 25 concurrent runs   |
| Pro          | 100+ concurrent runs |

Additional bundles above the Pro tier are available for $10/month per 100 concurrent runs. Contact us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact) or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) to request more.

## Rate limits

Generally speaking each SDK call is an API call.

| Limit | Details                   |
| :---- | :------------------------ |
| API   | 1,500 requests per minute |

<RateLimitHitUseBatchTrigger />

## Queued tasks

The number of queued tasks by environment.

| Limit   | Details            |
| :------ | :----------------- |
| Dev     | At most 500        |
| Staging | At most 10 million |
| Prod    | At most 10 million |

## Schedules

| Pricing tier | Limit              |
| :----------- | :----------------- |
| Free         | 10 per project     |
| Hobby        | 100 per project    |
| Pro          | 1,000+ per project |

Additional bundles above the Pro tier are available for $10/month per 1,000 schedules. Contact us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact) or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) to request more.

When attaching schedules to tasks we strongly recommend you add them [in our dashboard](/tasks/scheduled#attaching-schedules-in-the-dashboard) if they're "static". That way you can control them easily per environment.

If you add them [dynamically using code](/management/schedules/create) make sure you add a `deduplicationKey` so you don't add the same schedule to a task multiple times. If you don't your task will get triggered multiple times, it will cost you more, and you will hit the limit.

If you're creating schedules for your user you will definitely need to request more schedules from us.

## Preview branches

| Pricing tier | Limit                |
| :----------- | :------------------- |
| Free         | Not available        |
| Hobby        | 5 preview branches   |
| Pro          | 20+ preview branches |

Additional bundles above the Pro tier are available for $10/month per preview branch. Contact us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact) or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) to request more.

## Realtime connections

| Pricing tier | Limit                       |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- |
| Free         | 10 concurrent connections   |
| Hobby        | 50 concurrent connections   |
| Pro          | 500+ concurrent connections |

Additional bundles are available for $10/month per 100 realtime connections. Contact us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact) or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) to request more.

## Task payloads and outputs

| Limit                  | Details                                       |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Single trigger payload | Must not exceed 3MB                           |
| Batch trigger payload  | The total of all payloads must not exceed 5MB |
| Task outputs           | Must not exceed 10MB                          |

Payloads and outputs that exceed 512KB will be offloaded to object storage and a presigned URL will be provided to download the data when calling `runs.retrieve`. You don't need to do anything to handle this in your tasks however, as we will transparently upload/download these during operation.

## Batch size

A single batch can have a maximum of 500 items.

## Alerts

An alert destination is a single email address, Slack channel, or webhook URL that you want to send alerts to. 

| Pricing tier | Limit                   |

If you're on the Pro plan and need more than the plan limit, you can request more by contacting us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact) or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord).

## Machines

The default machine is `small-1x` which has 0.5 vCPU and 0.5 GB of RAM. You can optionally configure a higher spec machine which will increase the cost of running the task but can also improve the performance of the task if it is CPU or memory bound.

See the [machine configurations](/machines#machine-configurations) for more details.

## Team members
