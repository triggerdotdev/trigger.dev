## Concurrency limits

| Pricing tier | Limit                |
| :----------- | :------------------- |
| Free         | 5 concurrent runs    |
| Hobby        | 25 concurrent runs   |
| Pro          | 100+ concurrent runs |

If you need more than 100 concurrent runs on the Pro tier, you can request more by contacting us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact) or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord).

## Rate limits

Generally speaking each SDK call is an API call.

| Limit | Details                   |
| :---- | :------------------------ |
| API   | 1,500 requests per minute |

<RateLimitHitUseBatchTrigger />

## Queued tasks

The number of queued tasks by environment.

| Limit   | Details            |
| :------ | :----------------- |
| Dev     | At most 500        |
| Staging | At most 10 million |
| Prod    | At most 10 million |

## Schedules

| Pricing tier | Limit              |
| :----------- | :----------------- |
| Free         | 5 per project      |
| Hobby        | 100 per project    |
| Pro          | 1,000+ per project |

When attaching schedules to tasks we strongly recommend you add them [in our dashboard](/tasks/scheduled#attaching-schedules-in-the-dashboard) if they're "static". That way you can control them easily per environment.

If you add them [dynamically using code](/management/schedules/create) make sure you add a `deduplicationKey` so you don't add the same schedule to a task multiple times. If you don't your task will get triggered multiple times, it will cost you more, and you will hit the limit.

If you're creating schedules for your user you will definitely need to request more schedules from us.

## Task payloads and outputs

| Limit                  | Details                                       |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Single trigger payload | Must not exceed 3MB                           |
| Batch trigger payload  | The total of all payloads must not exceed 5MB |
| Task outputs           | Must not exceed 10MB                          |

Payloads and outputs that exceed 512KB will be offloaded to object storage and a presigned URL will be provided to download the data when calling `runs.retrieve`. You don't need to do anything to handle this in your tasks however, as we will transparently upload/download these during operation.

## Batch size

A single batch can have a maximum of 500 items.

<SoftLimit />

## Log retention

| Pricing tier | Limit   |
| :----------- | :------ |
| Free         | 1 day   |
| Hobby        | 7 days  |
| Pro          | 30 days |

## Log size

We limit the size of logs to prevent oversized data potentially causing issues.

<Expandable title="log limits">

#### Attribute Limits

- Span Attribute Count Limit: 256
- Log Attribute Count Limit: 256
- Span Attribute Value Length Limit: 1028 characters
- Log Attribute Value Length Limit: 1028 characters

#### Event and Link Limits

- Span Event Count Limit: 10
- Link Count Limit: 2
- Attributes per Link Limit: 10
- Attributes per Event Limit: 10

#### I/O Packet Length Limit

128 KB (131,072 bytes)

#### Attribute Clipping Behavior

- Attributes exceeding the value length limit (1028 characters) are discarded.
- If the total number of attributes exceeds 256, additional attributes are not included.

#### Attribute Value Size Calculation

- Strings: Actual length of the string
- Numbers: 8 bytes
- Booleans: 4 bytes
- Arrays: Sum of the sizes of all elements
- Undefined or null: 0 bytes

## Alerts

An alert destination is a single email address, Slack channel, or webhook URL that you want to send alerts to. If you're on the Pro and need more than 100 alert destinations, you can request more by contacting us via [email](https://trigger.dev/contact) or [Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord).

| Pricing tier | Limit                   |
| :----------- | :---------------------- |
| Free         | 1 alert destination     |
| Hobby        | 3 alert destinations    |
| Pro          | 100+ alert destinations |

## Machines

The default machine is `small-1x` which has 0.5 vCPU and 0.5 GB of RAM. You can optionally configure a higher spec machine which will increase the cost of running the task but can also improve the performance of the task if it is CPU or memory bound.

See the [machine configurations](/machines#machine-configurations) for more details.

## Team members

| Pricing tier | Limit            |
| :----------- | :--------------- |
| Free         | 5 team members   |
| Hobby        | 5 team members   |
| Pro          | 25+ team members |
