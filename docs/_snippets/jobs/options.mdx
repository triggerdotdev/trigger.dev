<ParamField body="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
      The `id` property is used to uniquely identify the Job. Only change this if you want to create a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
      The `name` of the Job that you want to appear in the dashboard and logs. You can change this without creating a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="version" type="string" required>
      The `version` property is used to version your Job. A new version will be created if you change this property. We recommend using [semantic versioning](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semantic-versioning), e.g. `1.0.3`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="trigger" type="object" required>
      The `trigger` property is used to define when the Job should run. There are currently the following Trigger types:
      - [invokeTrigger](/sdk/invoke-trigger)
      - [cronTrigger](/sdk/crontrigger)
      - [intervalTrigger](/sdk/intervaltrigger)
      - [eventTrigger](/sdk/eventtrigger)
      - [DynamicTrigger](/sdk/dynamictrigger)
      - [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule)
      - integration Triggers, like webhooks. See the [integrations](/integrations) page for more information.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="run" type="function" required>
      This function gets called automatically when a Run is Triggered. It has three parameters:
      1. `payload` – The payload that was sent to the Trigger API.
      2. [io](/sdk/io) – An object that contains the integrations that you specified in the `integrations` property and other useful functions like delays and running Tasks.
      3. [context](/sdk/context) – An object that contains information about the Organization, Job, Run and more.

      This is where you put the code you want to run for a Job. You can use normal code in here and you can also use Tasks.

      You can return a value from this function and it will be sent back to the Trigger API.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="integrations" type="object">
      Imports the specified integrations into the Job. The integrations will be available on the `io` object in the `run()` function with the same name as the key. For example:
      <Snippet file="how-to-pass-integrations.mdx" />
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="enabled" type="boolean">
      The `enabled` property is an optional property that specifies whether the Job is enabled or not. The Job will be enabled by default if you omit this property. When a job is disabled, no new runs will be triggered or resumed. In progress runs will continue to run until they are finished or delayed by using `io.wait`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="concurrencyLimit" type="number | ConcurrencyLimit">
      The `concurrencyLimit` property is an optional property that specifies the maximum number of concurrent run executions. If this property is omitted, the job can potentially use up the full concurrency of an environment. You can also create a limit on a group of jobs by defining a [ConcurrencyLimit](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/concurrency-limit) object.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="onSuccess" type="function">
      The `onSuccess` property is an optional property that specifies a callback function to run when the Job finishes successfully. The callback function receives a [Run Notification](/sdk/run-notification) object as it's only parameter.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="onFailure" type="function">
      The `onFailure` property is an optional property that specifies a callback function to run when the Job fails to complete successfully. The callback function receives a [Run Notification](/sdk/run-notification) object as it's only parameter.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="logLevel" type="log | error | warn | info | debug">
      The `logLevel` property is an optional property that specifies the level of
      logging for the Job. The level is inherited from the client if you omit this property.
      - `log` - logs only essential messages
      - `error` - logs error messages
      - `warn` - logs errors and warning messages
      - `info` - logs errors, warnings and info messages
      - `debug` - logs everything with full verbosity
    </ParamField>
