<ParamField body="options" type="object" required>
  <Expandable title="properties" defaultOpen>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
      The `id` property is used to uniquely identify the Job. Only change this if you want to create a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
      The `name` of the Job that you want to appear in the dashboard and logs. You can change this without creating a new Job.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="version" type="string" required>
      The `version` property is used to version your Job. A new version will be created if you change this property. We recommend using [semantic versioning](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semantic-versioning), e.g. `1.0.3`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="trigger" type="object" required>
      The `trigger` property is used to define when the Job should run. There are currently the following Trigger types:
      - [invokeTrigger](/sdk/invoke-trigger)
      - [cronTrigger](/sdk/crontrigger)
      - [intervalTrigger](/sdk/intervaltrigger)
      - [eventTrigger](/sdk/eventtrigger)
      - [DynamicTrigger](/sdk/dynamictrigger)
      - [DynamicSchedule](/sdk/dynamicschedule)
      - integration Triggers, like webhooks. See the [integrations](/integrations) page for more information.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="run" type="function" required>
      This function gets called automatically when a Run is Triggered. It has three parameters:
      1. `payload` – The payload that was sent to the Trigger API.
      2. [io](/sdk/io) – An object that contains the integrations that you specified in the `integrations` property and other useful functions like delays and running Tasks.
      3. [context](/sdk/context) – An object that contains information about the Organization, Job, Run and more.

      This is where you put the code you want to run for a Job. You can use normal code in here and you can also use Tasks.

      You can return a value from this function and it will be sent back to the Trigger API.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="integrations" type="object">
      Imports the specified integrations into the Job. The integrations will be available on the `io` object in the `run()` function with the same name as the key. For example:
      <Snippet file="how-to-pass-integrations.mdx" />
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="enabled" type="boolean">
      The `enabled` property is an optional property that specifies whether the Job is enabled or not. The Job will be enabled by default if you omit this property. When a job is disabled, no new runs will be triggered or resumed. In progress runs will continue to run until they are finished or delayed by using `io.wait`.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="onSuccess" type="function">
      The `onSuccess` property is an optional property that specifies a callback function to run when the Job finishes successfully. The callback function receives a [Run Notification](/sdk/run-notification) object as it's only parameter.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="onFailure" type="function">
      The `onFailure` property is an optional property that specifies a callback function to run when the Job fails to complete successfully. The callback function receives a [Run Notification](/sdk/run-notification) object as it's only parameter.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="logLevel" type="log | error | warn | info | debug">
      The `logLevel` property is an optional property that specifies the level of
      logging for the Job. The level is inherited from the client if you omit this property.
      - `log` - logs only essential messages
      - `error` - logs error messages
      - `warn` - logs errors and warning messages
      - `info` - logs errors, warnings and info messages
      - `debug` - logs everything with full verbosity
    </ParamField>
