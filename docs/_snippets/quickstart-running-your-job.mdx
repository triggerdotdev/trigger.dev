<Step title="Triggering the Job">

There are two way to trigger this Job.

1. Use the "Test" functionality in the dashboard.
2. Use the Trigger.dev API (either via our SDK or a web request)

#### "Testing" from the dashboard

Click into the Job and then open the "Test" tab. You should see this page:

This Job doesn't have a payload schema (meaning it takes an empty object), so you can simple click the "Run test" button.

**Congratulations, you should get redirected so you can see your first Run!**
