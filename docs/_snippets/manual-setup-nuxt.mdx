<Accordion defaultOpen title="Don't have a Nuxt project yet to add Trigger.dev to? No problem, you can complete the Manual Setup using a blank Nuxt project:">
Create a blank project by running the `nuxi@latest init <project-name>` command in your terminal:
<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

```bash yarn
yarn nuxi@latest init <project-name>
```

</CodeGroup>

</Accordion>

## Installing Required Packages

To begin, install the necessary packages in your Nuxt project directory. You can choose one of the following package managers:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/nuxtjs
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/nuxtjs
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/sdk @trigger-dev/nuxtjs
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Note>Ensure that you execute this command within a Nuxt project.</Note>

## Obtaining the Development API Key

To locate your development API key, login to the [Trigger.dev
dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev) and select the Project you want to
connect to. Then click on the Environments & API Keys tab in the left menu.
You can copy your development API Key from the field at the top of this page.
(Your development key will start with `tr_dev_`).

## Adding Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project and include your Trigger API key and URL like this:

```bash

TRIGGER_API_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE
TRIGGER_API_URL=https://cloud.trigger.dev

```

Replace `ENTER_YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key obtained from the previous step.

## Configuring the Trigger Client

To set up the Trigger Client for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Create Configuration File:**

   In your project directory, create a configuration file named `trigger.ts`.

2. **Choose Directory:**

   Depending on your project structure, choose the appropriate directory for the configuration file. If your project uses a `src` directory, create the file within it. Otherwise, create it directly in the project root.

3. **Add Configuration Code:**

   Open the configuration file you created and add the following code:

   ```typescript
   import { TriggerClient } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

   export const client = new TriggerClient({
     id: "my-app",
     apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY,
     apiUrl: process.env.TRIGGER_API_URL,
   });
   ```

   Replace **"my-app"** with an appropriate identifier for your project. The **apiKey** and **apiUrl** are obtained from the environment variables you set earlier.

4. **File Location:**

   Depending on your project structure, save the configuration file in the appropriate location:

   - If your project uses a **src** directory, save the file within the **src** directory.
   - If your project does not use a **src** directory, save the file in the project root.

   **Example Directory Structure with src:**

   ```
       project-root/
       ├── src/
           ├── trigger.ts
       ├── other files...
   ```

   **Example Directory Structure without src:**

   ```
       project-root/
       ├── trigger.ts
       ├── other files...
   ```

By following these steps, you'll configure the Trigger Client to work with your project, regardless of whether you have a separate **src** directory and whether you're using TypeScript or JavaScript files.

## Creating the API Route

To establish an API route for interacting with Trigger.dev, follow these steps.

    1. Create a new file named `trigger.ts` within the `server/api/` directory.
    2. Add the following code to `trigger.ts`:

    ```typescript
    import { client } from "@/trigger";
    import { createNuxtRoute } from "@trigger.dev/nuxtjs";
    import { eventTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

    client.defineJob({
      id: "hello-world",
      name: "Hello World",
      version: "0.0.1",
      trigger: eventTrigger({
        name: "starter.hello-world",
      }),
      run: async (_payload, io, _ctx) => {
        await io.logger.info("Hello world!");
        return {
          message: "Hello world!",
        };
      },
    });

    // Add your jobs here

    const nuxt = createNuxtRoute(client);

    export default defineEventHandler(nuxt);
    ```

## Adding Configuration to `package.json`

Inside the `package.json` file, add the following configuration under the root object:

```json
"trigger.dev": {
  "endpointId": "my-app"
}
```

Your `package.json` file might look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "trigger.dev": {
    "endpointId": "my-app"
  }
}
```

Replace **"my-app"** with the appropriate identifier you used during the step for creating the Trigger Client.

## Nuxt Steps

Start your Nuxt project locally, and then execute the `dev` CLI command to run Trigger.dev locally. You should run this command every time you want to use Trigger.dev locally.

![Your first Job](/images/cli-dev.gif)

<Warning>

Make sure your Nuxt site is running locally before continuing. You must also leave this `dev`
terminal command running while you develop.

</Warning>

In a **new terminal window or tab** run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the port if you're not running on 3000 by adding
  `--port 3001` to the end
</Note>
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the hostname if you're not running on localhost by adding
  `--hostname <host>`. Example, in case your Nuxt is running on 0.0.0.0: `--hostname 0.0.0.0`.
</Note>
