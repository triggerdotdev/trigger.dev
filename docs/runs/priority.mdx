description: "Specify a priority when triggering a run."

You can set a priority when you trigger a run. This allows you to prioritize some of your runs over others, so they are started sooner. This is very useful when:

- You have critical work that needs to start more quickly (and you have long queues).
- You want runs for your premium users to take priority over free users.

The value for priority is a time offset in seconds that determines the order of dequeuing.

If you specify a priority of `10` the run will dequeue before runs that were triggered with no priority 8 seconds ago, like in this example:

```ts
// no priority = 0
await myTask.trigger({ foo: "bar" });

//... imagine 8s pass by

// this run will start before the run above that was triggered 8s ago (with no priority)
await myTask.trigger({ foo: "bar" }, { priority: 10 });
```

If you passed a value of `3600` the run would dequeue before runs that were triggered an hour ago (with no priority).

<Note>
  Setting a high priority will not allow you to beat runs from other organizations. It will only affect the order of your own runs.
