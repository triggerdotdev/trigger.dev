## Overview

In the Trigger.dev dashboard we have built-in dashboards and you can create your own.

Dashboards are powered by [TRQL queries](/observability/query) with widgets that can be displayed as charts, tables, or single values. They automatically refresh to show the latest data.

### Available metrics data

Trigger.dev automatically collects process metrics (CPU, memory) and Node.js runtime metrics (event loop, heap) for all deployed tasks -- no configuration needed. Requires SDK version **4.4.1 or later**. You can also create custom metrics using the `otel.metrics` API from the SDK.

All of this data is available in the `metrics` table for use in dashboard widgets. See [Logging, tracing & metrics](/logging#metrics) for the full list of automatic metrics and how to create custom ones, or the [Query page](/observability/query#metrics-table-columns) for the `metrics` table schema.

### Visualization types

- **Line chart** - Show trends over time
- **Bar chart** - Compare values across categories
- **Area chart** - Display cumulative trends
- **Table** - Show detailed data in rows
- **Single value** - Display a single metric (count, sum, average, etc.)

You can also add Titles to your dashboard.

## Filtering and time ranges

All widgets on a dashboard use the time range filter applied to the dashboard.

You can also filter the data by:

- Scope: Environment, Project, Organization
- Tasks
- Queues

## Creating custom dashboards

1. In the sidebar click the + icon next to "Dashboards".
2. Name your custom dashboard.
3. From the top-right you can "Add chart" or "Add title".
4. For charts you write [TRQL queries](/observability/query) and choose a visualization type.
5. You can resize and reposition widgets on your dashboards.

## Performance considerations

### Optimize queries for metrics

1. **Use time bucketing** - `timeBucket()` automatically groups by appropriate intervals
2. **Limit result size** - Add `LIMIT` clauses, especially for table widgets
3. **Use approximate functions** - `uniq()` instead of `uniqExact()` for faster approximate counts

## Exporting metric data

Export data from any metric widget:

1. Click the widget menu (three dots)
2. Select "Copy JSON" or "Copy CSV"

## Best practices

1. **Start simple** - Begin with basic metrics and iterate based on insights
2. **Use meaningful names** - Give widgets clear, descriptive titles
3. **Group related metrics** - Organize dashboards by theme (performance, costs, errors)
4. **Test queries first** - Use the Query page to develop and test before adding to dashboards

## Troubleshooting

### Widget shows "No data"

- Check that your query returns results in the Query page
- Verify time filters include the period with data
- Ensure task/queue filters match existing runs

### Widget is slow to load

- Add time range filters to your query
- Use `LIMIT` clauses
- Simplify aggregations
- Check query execution time in Query page

### Chart displays incorrectly

- Verify column names match visualization config
- Check data types (numbers for charts, dates for time series)
- Ensure `timeBucket()` is used for time-series charts
- Review that series columns exist in query results

## Limits

Dashboards are powered by Query so have [the same limits](/observability/query#limits) as Query.

There is a separate concurrency limits for metric widgets.

| Limit                     | Details        |
| :------------------------ | :------------- |
| Concurrent widget queries | 30 per project |

See [Limits](/limits) for details.
