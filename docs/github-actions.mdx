This simple GitHub action file will deploy your Trigger.dev tasks when new code is pushed to the `main` branch and the `trigger` directory has changes in it.

<Warning>
  The deploy step will fail if any version mismatches are detected. Please see the [version
  pinning](/github-actions#version-pinning) section for more details.
</Warning>

```yaml .github/workflows/release-trigger-prod.yml
name: Deploy to Trigger.dev (prod)

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - "trigger/**"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20.x"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: ðŸš€ Deploy Trigger.dev
        env:
          TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

```yaml .github/workflows/release-trigger-staging.yml
name: Deploy to Trigger.dev (staging)

# Requires manually calling the workflow from a branch / commit to deploy to staging
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20.x"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: ðŸš€ Deploy Trigger.dev
        env:
          TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          npx trigger.dev@latest deploy --env staging
```

If you already have a GitHub action file, you can just add the final step "ðŸš€ Deploy Trigger.dev" to your existing file.

### Creating a Personal Access Token

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a new access token">
  Go to your profile page and click on the ["Personal Access
  Tokens"](https://cloud.trigger.dev/account/tokens) tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to your repository on GitHub.">
  Click on 'Settings' -> 'Secrets and variables' -> 'Actions' -> 'New repository secret'
</Step>

<Step title="Add the TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN">
  Add the name `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and the value of your access token. ![Add TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN

</Step>

</Steps>

## Version pinning

The CLI and `@trigger.dev/*` package versions need to be in sync with the `trigger.dev` CLI, otherwise there will be errors and unpredictable behavior. Hence, the `deploy` command will automatically fail during CI on any version mismatches.
Tip: add the deploy command to your `package.json` file to keep versions managed in the same place. For example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:trigger-prod": "npx trigger.dev@3.0.0 deploy",
    "deploy:trigger": "npx trigger.dev@3.0.0 deploy --env staging"
  }
}
```

Your workflow file will follow the version specified in the `package.json` script, like so:

```yaml .github/workflows/release-trigger.yml
- name: ðŸš€ Deploy Trigger.dev
  env:
    TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    npm run deploy:trigger
```

You should use the version you run locally during dev and manual deploy. The current version is displayed in the banner, but you can also check it by appending `--version` to any command.
