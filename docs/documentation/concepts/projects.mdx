title: "Projects"
description: "Projects are a group of [Jobs](/documentation/concepts/jobs-runs-tasks) with [Environments](/documentation/concepts/environments-apikeys)"

User's are members of one or more Organizations. Each Organization can have many Projects.

Jobs are scoped to a specific Project. This means they can only be run in the context of a Project. Jobs are associated with a Project by using a Project API key.

Currently all members of an Organization have access to all Projects. More granular access control will be added in the future.
