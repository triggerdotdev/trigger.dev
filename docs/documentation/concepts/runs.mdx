description: "When a [Job](/documentation/concepts/jobs) is [Triggered](/documentation/concepts/triggers), the Run function is called."

> Everytime a Job is triggered, a Run is created with a payload of data.

## Anatomy of a Run

A Run is a record of the execution of a Job. It is created from `run()` function of a Job.

```ts
new Job(client, {
  id: "event-1",
  name: "Run when the foo.bar event happens",
  version: "0.0.1",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "foo.bar",
    schema: z.object({
      url: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  // 1. Run function with params
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // 2. Regular code and Tasks
  },
});
```

1. The `run()` function is called with some useful parameters. More on that in a second.
2. Inside the run function you can write regular code and use [Tasks](/documentation/concepts/tasks).

## Resumability

Runs can exceed the maximum timeout on serverless platforms. If a Run exceeds this limit, it will be re-run. When it is re-run, any completed Tasks return their original output and they aren't re-run. Read more about [Resumability](/documentation/concepts/resumability).

## Run function parameters

### payload

The payload is the data that triggered the Job. It is the same data that was sent to the [Trigger](/documentation/concepts/triggers) that triggered the Job.

- For [Webhooks](/documentation/concepts/triggers/webhooks) the payload is the data from the webhook.
- For [Events](/documentation/concepts/triggers/events) the payload is the data from the event, in the example above that's `{ url: "https://..." }`.
- For [Scheduled](/documentation/concepts/triggers/scheduled) the payload is an object with the timestamp and the last timestamp (previous run).

### io

The `io` object gives you access to [Integrations](/documentation/concepts/integrations) and other useful functions. [View the full reference](/sdk/io) for `io`.

A few things you can do with `io`:

- Use [Integrations](/documentation/concepts/integrations).
- Add [delays](/documentation/concepts/delays) (that can be longer than your server timeout).
- Log messages to the [Run log](/documentation/guides/viewing-runs).
- Perform [background fetch requests](/documentation/sdk/io) (that can be longer than your server timeout).
- [Send events](/documentation/concepts/triggers/events) to Trigger other Jobs.
- Create a [Task](/documentation/concepts/tasks) manually by wrapping code in `io.runTask`.

### context

The `context` object gives you access to information about the current Run, Job, Environment, Organization and Event. [View the full reference](/sdk/context) for `context`.
