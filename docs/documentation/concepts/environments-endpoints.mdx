When you login to your Project there's a section called "Environments & API Keys".

## Environments

Each environment has an API Key associated with it. This API Key is used to authenticate your Jobs with the Trigger.dev platform.

The API Key you use for your [Client](/documentation/concepts/client-adaptors) is how we know which environment to run your code against:

```ts
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "nextjs-example",
  //this environment variable should be set to your DEV API Key locally,
  //and your PROD API Key in production
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY!,
});
```

### Development

The `DEV` environment should only be used for local development. It's where you can test your Jobs before deploying them to servers.

### Staging

The `STAGING` environment is useful for testing your Jobs against your staging server, if you have one. STAGING works identically to PROD.

### Production

The `PROD` environment is where your Jobs will run in production. It's where you can run your Jobs against real data.

## Endpoints

An Endpoint is a URL on your server that Trigger.dev can connect to. This URL is used to register Jobs, start them and orchestrate runs and retries.

`DEV` has multiple endpoints associated with it â€“ one for each team member. This allows each team member to run their own Jobs, without interfering with each other.

All other environments have just a single endpoint (with a single URL) associated with them.
