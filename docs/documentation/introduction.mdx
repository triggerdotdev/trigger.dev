<Snippet file="v3-redirect-warning.mdx" />

Trigger.dev is an open source framework for creating long-running Jobs directly in your app with API Integrations, webhooks, scheduling and delays. You can reliably run Jobs that wouldn't normally work in serverless environments (like Vercel) because of timeouts.

You can use [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev) or [Self-host Trigger.dev](/documentation/guides/self-hosting) on your own infrastructure.

<Note>Trigger.dev v2 currently only supports serverless.</Note>
