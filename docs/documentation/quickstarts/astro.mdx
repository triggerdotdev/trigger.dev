This quick start guide will get you up and running with Trigger.dev.

<Accordion title="Need to create a new Astro project to add Trigger.dev to?">
No problem, create a blank project by running the `create-next-app` command in your terminal then continue with this quickstart guide as normal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Trigger.dev works with either the Pages or App Router configuration.

## Create a Trigger.dev account

You can either:

- Use the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev).
- Or [self-host](/documentation/guides/self-hosting) the service.

### Create your first project

Once you've created an account, follow the steps in the app to:

1. Complete your account details.
2. Create your first Organization and Project.

### Getting an API key

1. Go to the "Environments & API Keys" page in your project.
   ![Go to the Environments & API Keys page ](/images/environments-link.png)

2. Copy the `DEV` **SERVER** API key.

## Run the CLI `init` command

The easiest way to get started it to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing Next.js project, setup a route and give you an example file.

In a terminal window run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>

It will ask you a few questions

1. Are you using the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev) or [self-hosting](/documentation/guides/self-hosting)?
2. Enter your development API key. Enter the key you copied earlier.
3. Enter a unique ID for your endpoint (you can just use the default by hitting enter)

## Run your Next.js site

Make sure your Next.js site is running locally, we will connect to it to register your Jobs.

<Warning>You must leave this running for the rest of the steps.</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm run dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn run dev
```

</CodeGroup>

## Run the CLI `dev` command

The CLI `dev` command allows the Trigger.dev service to send messages to your Next.js site. This is required for registering Jobs, triggering them and running tasks. To achieve this it creates a tunnel (using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) so Trigger.dev can send messages to your machine.

You should leave the `dev` command running when you're developing.

In a **new terminal window or tab** run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the port if you're not running on 3000 by adding
  `--port 3001` to the end

<Accordion title="Experiencing an error? This could be due to middleware.">
Instructions of how to resolve any issues due to middleware [here](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/guides/platforms/nextjs#middleware)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced: Run your Next.js server together with the CLI">
You can modify your `package.json` to run both the Next.js server and the CLI `dev` command together.

1. Install the `concurrently` package:

  <CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn add concurrently --dev
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Modify your `package.json` file's `dev` script.

```json package.json
...
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently --kill-others npm:dev:*",
  "dev:next": "next dev",
  "dev:trigger": "npx @trigger.dev/cli dev",
  ...
}
...
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Your first job

The CLI init command created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file either `api/trigger/route.ts` or `pages/api/trigger.ts`.

In there is this Job:

```typescript
//Job definition – uses the client
client.defineJob({
  // 1. Metadata
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.0.1",
  // 2. Trigger
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "example.event",
  }),
  // 3. Run function
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // do something
    await io.logger.info("Hello world!", { payload });

    return {
      message: "Hello world!",
    };
  },
});
```

If you navigate to your Trigger.dev project you will see this Job in the "Jobs" section:

![Your first Job](/images/first-job.png)

## Triggering the Job

There are two way to trigger this Job.

1. Use the "Test" functionality in the dashboard.
2. Use the Trigger.dev API (either via our SDK or a web request)

### "Testing" from the dashboard

Click into the Job and then open the "Test" tab. You should see this page:

![Test Job](/images/test-job.png)

This Job doesn't have a payload schema (meaning it takes an empty object), so you can simple click the "Run test" button.

Congratulations, you should get redirected so you can see your first Run!
