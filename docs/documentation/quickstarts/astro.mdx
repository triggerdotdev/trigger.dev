This quick start guide will get you up and running with Trigger.dev.

<Accordion title="Need to create a new Astro project to add Trigger.dev to?">
No problem, create a blank project by running the `create-astro` command in your terminal then continue with this quickstart guide as normal:

```bash
npx create-astro@latest
```

</Accordion>

<Step title="Run the CLI `dev` command">

<Snippet file="quickstart-cli-dev.mdx" />

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Advanced: Run your Astro server together with the CLI">
You can modify your `package.json` to run both the Astro server and the CLI `dev` command together.

1. Install the `concurrently` package:

  <CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn add concurrently --dev
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Modify your `package.json` file's `dev` script.

```json package.json
//...
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently --kill-others npm:dev:*",
  //your normal astro dev command would go here
  "dev:astro": "astro dev",
  "dev:trigger": "npx @trigger.dev/cli dev",
  //...
}
//...
```

</Accordion>

<Step title="Your first job">

The CLI init command created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file `src/jobs/example.(ts/js)`.

In there is this Job:

<Snippet file="quickstart-example-job.mdx" />

If you navigate to your Trigger.dev project you will see this Job in the "Jobs" section:
