## Quickstart

This quick start guide will get you up and running with Trigger.dev.

<Accordion title="Need to create a new Remix project to add Trigger.dev to?">
No problem, create a blank project by running the `create-remix` command in your terminal then continue with this quickstart guide as normal:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

Trigger.dev works with Remix v1 and v2.

<Accordion title="Advanced: Run your Remix server together with the CLI">
You can modify your `package.json` to run both the Remix server and the CLI `dev` command together.

1. Install the `concurrently` package:

  <CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn add concurrently --dev
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Modify your `package.json` file's `dev` script.

```json package.json
//...
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently --kill-others npm:dev:*",
  //your normal remix dev command would go here
  "dev:remix": "remix dev",
  "dev:trigger": "npx @trigger.dev/cli dev",
  //...
}
//...
```

<Step title="Your first job">

The CLI init command created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file `app/jobs/example.server.(ts/js)`.

In there is this Job:

<Snippet file="quickstart-example-job.mdx" />

If you navigate to your Trigger.dev project you will see this Job in the "Jobs" section:
