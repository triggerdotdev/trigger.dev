## 1. Make sure your Client is configured correctly

The API Key you use for your `Client` is how we know which environment to run your code against:

```ts
export const client = new TriggerClient({
  id: "nextjs-example",
  //this environment variable should be set to your DEV API Key locally,
  //and your PROD API Key in production
  apiKey: process.env.TRIGGER_API_KEY!,
});
```

## 2. Include your Jobs in `sideEffects` if needed

If your `package.json` does not declare `sideEffects`, you can safely skip this step. Otherwise, include a glob pattern that matches your jobs so that they are not tree shaken away in your production bundle.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "sideEffects": [
    "./src/jobs/**/*.ts"
  ]
}
```

## 3. Set your environment variables on your server

Ensure that your `TRIGGER_API_KEY` (or whatever you've set it to) environment variable is set on your server, to the correct value from the "Environments & API Keys" page in your Trigger.dev dashboard.

If you've used any other environment variables in your code (like API Keys for other services), make sure they are set on your server too.

The exact instructions will vary depending on where you deploy to. Here are the docs links to some popular services:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/bindings/#environment-variables)
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/environment-variables/)
- [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/)

## 4. Deploy your code as usual

Your Job code lives in your codebase, so you can deploy it as you normally would.

## 5. Connect the Endpoint for the first time

1. Go to the "Environments & API Keys" page in your Trigger.dev dashboard
   ![Go to the Environments & API Keys page ](/images/environments-link.png)

2. Click the "Configure" button on the relevant endpoint

3. Enter the URL of your Trigger.dev endpoint
   ![Enter the URL of your Trigger.dev endpoint](/images/endpoint-setup-2.png)

   <Info>
     This is the value of the `path` option for the adaptor you're using. For
     Next.js, this would usually be `https://yourdomain.com/api/trigger`.
   </Info>

4. Click "Save". This will automatically connect, test your endpoint, and register all your Jobs.
