## Introduction

If you're setting up your project for the first time, we recommend using the CLI by following the [Quickstart guide](/documentation/quickstart).

## init Command

The `init` command incorporates Trigger.dev into your Next.js project. It performs the following functions:

- Adds Trigger.dev to the project.
- Creates a new route.
- Generates an example file.

  During execution, this command requires some configuration parameters. Detailed information on these parameters can be found in the next section.

Run this `init` command in a terminal window to setup your project with Trigger.dev

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>

### CLI steps explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are you using the Trigger.dev cloud or self-hosted?">
    <ResponseField name="Option 1: Trigger.dev Cloud">
      Trigger.dev Cloud is a fully hosted service that provides the easiest and quickest way to use Trigger.dev.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="Option 2: Self-hosted">
      Instead of using the Trigger.dev Cloud service which we host for you, you
      can host the Trigger.dev platform yourself. We provide an official
      Trigger.dev Docker image you can use to easily self-host on your preferred
      platform. More information on self-hosting can be found in the
      self-hosting section of the docs
      [here](/documentation/guides/self-hosting).
      <Accordion title="Enter the URL of your self-hosted Trigger.dev instance">
        When following the [self-hosting guide](/documentation/guides/self-hosting) you will deploy your Docker image to a platform of your choice. After completing this step, enter the URL of your self-hosted instance in this CLI step.

<Accordion title="Enter your development API key">
  To locate your development API key, login to the [Trigger.dev
  dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev) and select the Project you want to connect to. Then click on
  the Environments & API Keys tab in the left menu. You can copy your development API Key from the
  field at the top of this page. (Your development key will start with `tr_dev_`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Enter a unique ID for your endpoint">
  Enter a custom ID or use the default by hitting enter. You can learn more about endpoints
  [here](/documentation/concepts/environments-endpoints#endpoints).

## dev Command

Once you're running your Next.js project locally, you can then execute the `dev` CLI command to run Trigger.dev locally. You should run this command every time you want to use Trigger.dev locally.

![Your first Job](/images/cli-dev.gif)

<Warning>
  Make sure your Next.js site is running locally before continuing. You must also leave this `dev`
  terminal command running while you develop.
</Warning>

In a **new terminal window or tab** run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

<Note>
  You can optionally pass the port if you're not running on 3000 by adding
  `--port 3001` to the end
</Note>
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the hostname if you're not running on localhost by adding
  `--hostname <host>`. Example, in case your Next.js is running on 0.0.0.0: `--hostname 0.0.0.0`.
</Note>
