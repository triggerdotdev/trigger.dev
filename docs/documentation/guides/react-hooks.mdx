You can display the live progress of a Job Run to your users, including the status of individual tasks and the final output of the Run.

## Setting up your project for hooks

This guide assumes that your project is already setup and you have a Job running. If not, you should follow the [quick start guide](/documentation/quickstart) first.

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Install the package">
    Add the `@trigger.dev/react` package to your project:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm install @trigger.dev/react@latest
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm install @trigger.dev/react@latest
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add @trigger.dev/react@latest
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your public API key">
    In the Trigger.dev dashboard you should go to your Project and then the "Environments & API Keys" page.

    ![Get your public API Key](/images/environments-public-apikey.png)

    You should copy the `PUBLIC` API key for the dev environment.

    <Accordion title="What's a public API key?">
      A public API key is a key that can be used in the browser. It can only be used to read certain
      data from the API and can not write data. This means that it can be used to get the status of a
      Job Run, but not to start a new Job Run.
    </Accordion>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the env var to your project">
    Add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_API_KEY` environment variable to your project. This will be used by the `TriggerProvider` component to connect to the Trigger API.

    ```sh .env.local
    #...
    TRIGGER_API_KEY=[your_private_api_key]
    NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_API_KEY=[your_public_api_key]
    #...
    ```

    Your private API key should already be in there.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the <TriggerProvider> component">
    The [TriggerProvider](/sdk/react/triggerprovider) component is a React Context Provider that will make the Trigger API client available to all child components.

    Generally you'll want to add this to the root of your app, so that it's available everywhere. However, you can add it lower in the hierarchy but it must be above any of the hooks.

    ```tsx app/layout.tsx
    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body className={inter.className}>
            <TriggerProvider publicApiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_API_KEY!}>
              {children}
            </TriggerProvider>
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Two ways to report Run progress

**Automatic progress** – without writing additional code in your Job you can get updates on the overall run status and individual tasks inside the run.

**Explicit status** – add code to your Job that reports the status of the things you're doing. This gives you full flexibility for displaying progress in your UI.
