Welcome to the Trigger.dev Task Library üìö. You may be wondering, what is a Task and why are there a library of them? Well you see, Trigger.dev works by divvying up a long-running job execution into a bunch of little tasks, each one taking less time then a single serverless function execution. üí´

You can define and run your own tasks easily using [io.runTask()](/sdk/io/runtask), or you can use one of our [Integrations](/integrations/introduction) which are tasks for specific APIs, like OpenAI or Stripe.

<Note>Read more about how Tasks work [here](/documentation/concepts/tasks).</Note>

We also have a growing library of built-in tasks that you can use in your Jobs through the `io` object. These tasks are designed to be generic and reusable, and are a great way to get started with Trigger.dev.

<Info>
  You may notice that I'm using emojis for all the cache keys below, which is totally üíØ% fine as
  long as they are unique inside a run. Read more about how cache keys work
  [here](/documentation/concepts/tasks#task-cache-keys)
</Info>

## `wait`

This task allows you to resume executing your job after a certain amount of time has passed:

```ts
await io.wait("‚è∞", 60); // wait 60 seconds
```

Internally this task is considered a "noop", and noop tasks have no output.

[reference docs](/sdk/io/wait)

## `waitForRequest`

You supply this task with a callback to receive a URL. When a POST request is made to that URL, the JSON body of the request becomes the task output.

The example below uses `waitForRequest` to capture a Screenshot of a website using [ScreenshotOne.com](https://screenshotone.com/) and passes the callback URL to the webhook URL to get notified when the screenshot is finished:

```ts
const result = await io.waitForRequest<ScreenshotResponse>(
  "üì∏",
  async (url) => {
    await fetch(`https://api.screenshotone.com/take`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        webhook_url: url, // this is the URL that will be called when the screenshot is ready
        access_key: "my-access-key",
        url: "https://trigger.dev",
        store: "true",
        storage_path: "my-screeshots",
        response_type: "json",
        async: "true",
        storage_return_location: "true",
      }),
    });
  },
  {
    timeoutInSeconds: 300, // wait up to 5 minutes for the screenshot to be ready
  }
);
```

We actually originally built this task for our [Replicate integration](/integrations/apis/replicate), which accepts a callback URL to notify you when a prediction is ready. So this allows you to write very succinct code to create a prediction and wait for it's results:

```ts
const sdPrediction = await io.replicate.predictions.createAndAwait("üßë‚Äçüé®", {
  version: "ac732df83cea7fff18b8472768c88ad041fa750ff7682a21affe81863cbe77e4",
  input: {
    prompt: "What is the meaning of life?",
  },
});
```

## `waitForEvent`

This task allows you to wait for an event to be sent. To read about how events work, check out the [Events](/documentation/concepts/triggers/events) documentation.

```ts
const event = await io.waitForEvent(
  "ü•Ç",
  {
    name: "user.created",
    schema: z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      createdAt: z.coerce.date(),
      isAdmin: z.boolean(),
    }),
    filter: {
      isAdmin: [true], // Only wait for events where isAdmin is true
    },
  },
  {
    timeoutInSeconds: 60 * 60, // Wait for up to an hour
  }
);
```

The event object returned from this task is the full event object that was sent, including `id`, `name`, `payload`, `context`, and more.

[reference docs](/sdk/io/wait-for-event)

## `backgroundFetch`

This task allows you to perform a `fetch` request in the background, and then resume the execution of your job after the request has completed.

```ts
const body = io.backgroundFetch<MyResponseData>("üï∏Ô∏è", "https://example.com/api/endpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: redactString`Bearer ${auth.apiKey}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ foo: "bar" }),
});
```

This is useful for when an API is slow to respond and might not finish before your serverless function times out. We created this task to power our [OpenAI integration](/integrations/apis/openai), which can sometimes take more than a minute to respond:

```ts
// This uses backgroundFetch under the hood
await io.openai.chat.completions.backgroundCreate("üí¨", {
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Create a good programming joke about background jobs",
    },
  ],
});
```

[reference docs](/sdk/io/backgroundfetch)

## `backgroundPoll`

This task is similar to `backgroundFetch`, but instead of waiting for a single request to complete, it will poll a URL until it returns a certain value.

```ts
const result = await io.backgroundPoll<{ foo: string }>("üîÉ", {
  url: "https://example.com/api/endpoint",
  interval: 10, // every 10 seconds
  timeout: 300, // stop polling after 5 minutes
  responseFilter: {
    // stop polling once this filter matches
    status: [200],
    body: {
      status: ["SUCCESS"],
    },
  },
});
```

## `logger`

The logger object allows you to log messages to the Trigger.dev console. This is useful for debugging your jobs, or just to see what's going on inside your job.

```ts
await io.logger.info("This is an info message");
```

You can optionally pass a `context` object to the logger, which will be displayed in the console:

```ts
await io.logger.info("This is an info message", {
  foo: "bar",
});
```

We support the following log levels:

- `io.logger.debug()`
- `io.logger.info()`
- `io.logger.warn()`
- `io.logger.error()`

<Note>
  You may notice these tasks don't include cache keys. We automatically create a cache key for you
  based on the message and the log-level
</Note>

## `random`

Use this task to generate a random number that stays stable during run retries/resumes:

```ts
const randomNumber = await io.random("üé≤", {
  min: 1,
  max: 100,
});
```

[reference docs](/sdk/io/random)

## `sendEvent`

This task allows you to send an event from inside your job run.

If you want to send an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you should use [client.sendEvent()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/sendevent) instead.

```ts
await io.sendEvent("üöö", {
  id: "e_1234567890",
  name: "new.user",
  payload: {
    userId: "u_1234567890",
  },
});
```

[reference docs](/sdk/io/sendevent)

## `getEvent`

This task allows you to get an event by ID from inside your job run.

If you want to get an event from outside a run (e.g. just from your backend) you should use [client.getEvent()](/sdk/triggerclient/instancemethods/getevent) instead.

```ts
const event = await io.getEvent("üì•", "e_1234567890");
```

[reference docs](/sdk/io/getevent)

## `cancelEvent`

If you send an event that has a delivery date in the future, you can use this task to cancel it.

```ts
await io.sendEvent(
  "üöö",
  {
    id: "e_1234567890",
    name: "new.user",
    payload: {
      userId: "u_1234567890",
    },
  },
  {
    deliverAt: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24), // deliver in 24 hours
  }
);

// Later on, if you want to cancel the event:
await io.cancelEvent("üö´", "e_1234567890");
```

## `createStatus`
