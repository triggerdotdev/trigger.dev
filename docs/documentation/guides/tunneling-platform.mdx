Note this is only relevant to you if you are [running the platform locally](/documentation/guides/self-hosting).

## How do I do it?

There are a few ways to do this, but we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). It's free and easy to use.

### Start ngrok

1. Install ngrok:

<CodeGroup>
```sh Mac
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

```sh Windows
choco install ngrok
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Open a new terminal window/tab, you need to leave this running

3. Create an http tunnel at port 3030:

```sh
ngrok http 3030
```

4. Grab your forwarding address in the ngrok output:

![ngrok](/images/ngrok.png)

### 2. Use the forwarding URL

Use the forwarding URL that ngrok gave you for the `LOGIN_ORIGIN` and `API_ORIGIN` environment variables for the docker container.
