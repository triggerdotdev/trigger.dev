## Disabling Jobs

To prevent a Job from processing new Runs, you can disable it by setting the `enabled` option:

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({ name: "example.event" }),
  enabled: false,
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // your Job code here
  },
});
```

If you omit the `enabled` option, it will default to `true`.

The Job will only be disabled in environments that have seen the `enabled = false` value. So the Job will remain enabled in production until the code with the `enabled = false` is deployed to production.

<Note>
  Currently this is the only way to disable a Job. If you'd like to disable a Job in the Dashboard,
  please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kA47vcd8P6) and let us know ðŸ‘‹
</Note>

Once a Job is disabled no **new** Runs will be created for that Job, and it will still be visible in the Dashboard as disabled:

### In-progress Runs

In-progress Runs will be allowed to finish, even Runs that are currently delayed from a call to `io.wait`. If you'd like to completely stop in-progress Runs, you have two options:

- Set the `enabled` option to false and then `throw` an error at the top of your Job `run` function.

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({ name: "example.event" }),
  enabled: false,
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    throw new Error("Job disabled");
  },
});
```

- Delete the Job from your codebase. This will disable the Job as well but also stop in progress Runs.

### Disabling in production with env vars

You can easily disable Jobs in production using env vars so you don't have to deploy new code to disable a Job.

```ts
client.defineJob({
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "0.1.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({ name: "example.event" }),
  enabled: process.env.TRIGGER_JOBS_DISABLED === "true",
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    // your Job code here
  },
});
```

Then you can disable the Job in production by setting the `TRIGGER_JOBS_DISABLED` env var to `"true"`. And removing the env var will re-enable the Job.

## Deleting Jobs

Once you have disabled a Job in all environments, you can delete it from the dashboard by navigating to the Job list page and clicking the "triple-dot" menu next to the Job you want to delete:

This will bring up a dialog confirming that you want to delete the Job and all of its history:
