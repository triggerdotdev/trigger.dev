title: "Deploy to Kubernetes"
description: "Deploy self hosted version of [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) to your kubernetes cluster using our helm chart"
---
**Prerequisites**
- You have understanding of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- Installed [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh/) version v3.11.3 or greater
- You have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) installed and connected to your kubernetes cluster

By deploying Trigger.dev on Kubernetes, you can take advantage of its features to ensure that the application is fault-tolerant, highly available, and scalable.
To make the installation process easier and more streamlined, we have created a Helm chart that you can use to install Trigger.dev on Kubernetes. 

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the installation and management of Kubernetes applications. 
With our Helm chart, you can easily install Trigger.dev on Kubernetes, configure it to your liking, and scale it up or down as needed. 

## Install Trigger.dev Helm repository 

```bash
TODO: Add helm repo to artifact hub or cloudsmith
```

## Add Helm values 

Create a values.yaml file to configure various installation settings, such as the docker image tags and environment variables. To explore all configurable properties for your values file, [visit this page](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/tree/main/helm-charts/).

#### Set image tags

By default, the application will use the latest tag to retrieve the required Docker images, which may be appropriate for most cases. 
However, we recommend that you use a specific version of the Docker image to avoid unexpected changes to the application.

<Tip>
  To find the latest version number of Trigger.dev, follow the link below 
  - [Trigger.dev image on github packaes](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/pkgs/container/trigger.dev) 
</Tip>

```yaml simple-values-example.yaml 
trigger:
  name: trigger
  replicaCount: 2
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev
    tag: "latest" # <--- frontend version 
    pullPolicy: Always
```

#### Configure environment variables

You can configure environment variables for trigger in your Helm values file under the property `envVars`. View configurable [environment variables](../configuration/envars).

Infisical requires the following backend environment variables to be defined: _`MAGIC_LINK_SECRET`_, _`SESSION_SECRET`_, _`ENCRYPTION_KEY`_, _`DIRECT_URL`_, and _`DATABASE_URL`_ . 

However, when the above environment variables are not defined, the Helm chart 
will automatically generate these environment variables for you. The generated environment variables will be saved to a Kubernetes secret and will be preserved between upgrades or uninstalls. 

```yaml simple-values-example.yaml 
...
envVars:
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: "b1ebe43a6a6e24b2aa8fa0707d3890e3"
  MAGIC_LINK_SECRET: "842727396bcee22da68518f959c5730b"
  ...
```
#### Routing external traffic
By default, Trigger.dev takes all traffic coming to your external load balancer's IP address and routes them Trigger.dev's services. 
Infisical uses Nginx to route external traffic. You can install Nginx along with Trigger by setting `ingress.enabled` to `true` in the Helm values file. View all [properties for ingress](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/tree/main/helm-charts/).

```yaml simple-values-example.yaml 
...
ingress:
  nginx:
    enabled: true #<-- if you would like to install nginx along with Trigger.dev
```

#### Database 
Trigger.dev uses a SQL database as its persistence layer. With this Helm chart, you spin up a PostgreSQL instance powered by Bitnami along side other Trigger.dev services in your cluster. 
When persistence is enabled, the data will be stored as Kubernetes Persistence Volume. View all [properties for postgresql](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/tree/main/helm-charts/).

```yaml simple-values-example.yaml 
postgresql:
  enabled: true
  persistence:
    enabled: true
```

#### Example helm values
```yaml simple-values-example.yaml 
trigger:
  name: trigger
  replicaCount: 2
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev
    tag: "latest" 
    pullPolicy: Always

envVars:
  ENCRYPTION_KEY: "b1ebe43a6a6e24b2aa8fa0707d3890e3"
  MAGIC_LINK_SECRET: "842727396bcee22da68518f959c5730b"

ingress:
  nginx:
    enabled: true #<-- if you would like to install nginx along with Infisical

```

  trigger:
    enabled: true

  ## Postgresql DB persistence 
  postgresql:
    enabled: true
    persistence:
      enabled: true

  ingress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod" # <-- if you are setting up HTTPS
    hostName: app.yourdomain.com ## <- Replace with your own domain
    trigger:
      path: /
      pathType: Prefix
    tls: # <-- if you are setting up HTTPS
      - secretName: echo-tls
        hosts:
          - app.yourdomain.com

  ```
</Accordion>

## Install the Helm chart 

By default, the helm chart will be installed on your default namespace. If you wish to install the Chart on a different namespace, you may specify
that by adding the `--namespace <namespace-to-install-to>` to your `helm install` command.

```bash
## Installs to default namespace
TODO: not published
```

## Access Trigger.dev
Allow 3-5 minutes for the deployment to complete. Once done, you should now be able to access Trigger.dev on the IP address exposed via Ingress on your load balancer. If you are not sure what the IP address is run `kubectl get ingress` to view the external IP address exposing Trigger.dev.
  
<Info>
Once installation is complete, you will have to create the first account. No default account is provided.
