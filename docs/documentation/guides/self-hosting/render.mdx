You can use this [repository](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/render.com) as a jumping off point for deploying a self-hosted version of Trigger.dev on Render using the Trigger.dev public docker image located at `ghcr.io/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev:latest`

### Fork the repository mentioned above and change the app name

You should fork the repository before starting so you can make changes and commit them. For example, in render.yaml file you'll need to change the name under services to a unique name for your app.

### Create a new web service

1. Go to the Render dashboard.

2. Click on "New" in the top right corner.

3. Choose "Web service"

4. Click on "Connect With GitHub" (if you have not already done so). You will need to authorize Render to access your GitHub repositories.

5. Once connected, you will see a list of your repositories. Choose the repository that contains your project.

6. Render will detect the render.yaml file in your repository and auto fill the fields, add your app name now.

7. Scrolldown, click on advanced. Here you will need to add the environment variables

### Gather your secret environment variables

The process for generating and collecting the required environment variables is identical to the one described in the [Fly.io guide](/documentation/guides/self-hosting/flyio#gather-your-secret-environment-variables). Follow the steps there to generate and collect the required environment variables.

### Set the environment variables

The render.yaml file declares several environment variables that your app needs to run. These include the `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `MAGIC_LINK_SECRET` and `SESSION_SECRET`, and others. You need to manually set the values of these environment variables in the Render dashboard:

1. Click on "Add Environment Variable" to add a new environment variable.
2. Enter the key and value for each environment variable declared in your render.yaml file. The key should match the name of the environment variable in the render.yaml file.

### Deploy

Render automatically deploys your service when you push to the connected GitHub repository. Alternatively, you can manually trigger a deployment from the Render dashboard by clicking "Deploy" in the "Deploys" tab.

### Initialize your Next.js project

Next, you can easily bootstrap your Next.js project to use your self-hosted instance of Trigger.dev.

First, cd into your Next.js project, then run the `@trigger.dev/cli init` command to initialize your Next.js project:

```sh
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init -t "https://<your render app name>.onrender.com"
```

When it asks for your development API key, head over to your self-hosted Trigger.dev dashboard and select the initial project you created when signing up, and head to the `Environments & API Keys` page to copy your `dev` API key:

### Start your dev server

Run your Next.js project dev server with `npm run dev` and then in a new terminal window you will need to run the `@trigger.dev/cli dev` command to connect to your Trigger.dev instance and allow it to tunnel to your local Next.js server:

```sh
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

At this point you should be able to navigate to your Trigger.dev dashboard and view your registered jobs
