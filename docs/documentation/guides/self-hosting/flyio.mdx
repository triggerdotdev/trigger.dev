description: "Deploy self hosted version of [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) to Fly.io"
---

You can use this [repository](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/fly.io) as a jumping off point for deploying a self-hosted version of Trigger.dev on Fly.io using the Trigger.dev public docker image located at `ghcr.io/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev:latest`

## Fork the repository mentioned above and change the app name

You should fork the repository before starting so you can make changes and commit them. For example, you'll need to change the `app` property in the `fly.toml` file to be something other than `app = "trigger-v2-fly-demo"`.

## Install and configure the fly.io CLI

1. Install the Fly CLI tool:

<CodeGroup>

```sh Mac
brew install flyctl
```

```sh Windows
pwsh -Command "iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex"
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Authenticate the CLI:

```sh
fly auth login
```

## Create the fly.io app and pg db

1. Launch the app:

```sh
fly launch
```

2. Follow the prompts by `fly launch` and make sure to answer them in the following way:

```sh
? Would you like to copy its configuration to the new app? Yes
? Choose an app name (leaving blank will default to 'trigger-v2-fly-demo') <enter your preferred app name here or leave blank>
? Would you like to set up a Postgresql database now? Yes
? Select configuration: Development - Single node, 1x shared CPU, 256MB RAM, 1GB disk <- feel free to pick a beefier machine
? Would you like to set up an Upstash Redis database now? No
? Would you like to deploy now? No
```

## Gather your secret environment variables

### Required

`MAGIC_LINK_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`

All of these secrets should be 16-byte random strings, which you can easily generate (and copy into your pasteboard) with the following command:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 16 | pbcopy
```

`LOGIN_ORIGIN` and `APP_ORIGIN`

Both of these secrets should be set to the base URL of your fly application. For example `https://trigger-v2-fly-demo.fly.dev`

### Optional

`AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

1. If you plan on logging in with GitHub auth, you'll need to create a GitHub OAuth app with the following configuration:

![github oauth](/images/github-oauth.png)

2. Once you register the application you'll need to click on the "Generate new client secret" button:

![github generate new secret](/images/github-generate-new-secret.png)

3. And then you can copy out the AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET:

![github copy secrets](/images/github-secrets.png)

`RESEND_API_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL` and `REPLY_TO_EMAIL`

We use [Resend.com](https://resend.com) for email sending (including the magic-link signup/login system). They have a generous free tier of 100 emails a day that should be sufficient. Signup for Resend.com and enter the environment vars below

## Set the secrets

Call the `fly secrets set` command to stage the secrets to be used on first deploy:

```sh
fly secrets set \
  ENCRYPTION_KEY=<random string> \
  MAGIC_LINK_SECRET=<random string> \
  SESSION_SECRET=<random string> \
  LOGIN_ORIGIN="https://<fly app name>.fly.dev" \
  APP_ORIGIN="https://<fly app name>.fly.dev" \
  FROM_EMAIL="Acme Inc. <hello@yourdomain.com>" \
  REPLY_TO_EMAIL="Acme Inc. <reply@yourdomain.com>" \
  RESEND_API_KEY=<your API Key> \
  AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your GitHub OAuth Client ID> \
  AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your GitHUb OAuth Client Secret>

Secrets are staged for the first deployment
```

## Deploy

Now you can deploy to fly. Here we are setting the machine VM size to use 1 dedicated CPU core with 2 GB of memory, but you can run `fly platform vm-sizes` to see other options. The below app will cost about $30/month.

```sh
fly deploy --vm-size performance-1x
```

## Visit and create an account

Once deployed, you should be able to open `https://<your fly app name>.fly.dev/` in your browser and create an account, either using GitHub or a magic email link.

## Initialize your Next.js project

Next you can easily bootstrap your Next.js project to use your self-hosted instance of Trigger.dev.

First, `cd` into your Next.js project, then run the `@trigger.dev/cli init` command to initialize your Next.js project:

```sh
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest init -t "https://<your fly app name>.fly.dev"
```

When it asks for your development API key, head over to your self-hosted Trigger.dev dashboard and select the initial project you created when signing up, and head to the `Environments & API Keys` page to copy your `dev` API key:

![api key](/images/api-key.png)

## Start your dev server

Run your Next.js project dev server with `npm run dev` and then in a new terminal window you will need to run the `@trigger.dev/cli dev` command to connect to your Trigger.dev instance and allow it to tunnel to your local Next.js server:

```sh
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

At this point you should be able to navigate to your Trigger.dev dashboard and view your registered jobs
