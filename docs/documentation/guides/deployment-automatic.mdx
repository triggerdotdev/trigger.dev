## How to use the webhook URL

### Vercel

You can use this webhook URL in your Vercel dashboard, so when a deployment succeeds it automatically refreshes the endpoint.

1. From your Vercel team dashboard, select "Settings"

2. Go to the "Webhooks" page

3. Select the "Deployment Succeeded" event, your Vercel Project, and paste in our webhook URL. Then "Create Webhook".

4. You're done! Whenever a deploy succeeds, Vercel will tell us to refresh your endpoint.

### GitHub Actions

You can add a step to the GitHub Action that deploys your app.

```yaml .github/workflows/release.yml
- name: 🚀 Refresh Trigger.dev Jobs
   env:
      DEPLOY_TEST_HOOK: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ENDPOINT_HOOK }}
   run: |
      curl -X POST $TRIGGER_ENDPOINT_HOOK
```

You will need to [setup the `TRIGGER_ENDPOINT_HOOK` secret in your GitHub repo](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). Set it to the webhook URL from the endpoint panel.

### Do an HTTP request yourself

Any `GET` or `POST` request to the webhook URL will cause a refresh of the Jobs for that endpoint. `POST` requests don't need a body. There is no authentication required.
