Deployment uses [Environments & Endpoints](/documentation/concepts/environments-endpoints) to connect your Jobs to the Trigger.dev platform.

## First time deploying to a new Environment

The first time you deploy to a new environment you will need to setup the
endpoint for that environment.

  This only needs to be done once for each environment
</Card>

## Subsequent deployments (i.e. refreshing your Endpoint)

If you add new Jobs, change the id of a Job, or change the Triggers of a Job then you will need to refresh your Endpoint.

There are two ways to do this:

    Manually refresh in your Trigger.dev dashboard
  </Card>

    Automatically refresh by using our webhook
  </Card>
