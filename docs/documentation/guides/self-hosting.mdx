## What does this mean?

Instead of using the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev) service which we host for you, you can host the Trigger.dev platform yourself.

## Local development

When you're working on your web app, you can run Trigger.dev locally alongside your web app.

- See our [GitHub docker project](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/docker) for instructions.
- You will need to [setup tunneling](/documentation/guides/tunneling-platform) if you want to receive webhooks from external services.

## Deployment

We provide an official Trigger.dev [docker image](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/pkgs/container/trigger.dev) you can use to easily self-host on your preferred platform. We also provide guides for some popular platforms:
