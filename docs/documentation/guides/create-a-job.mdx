> Jobs are the core of the system. They allow you to run code when some event occurs. They are built using a combination of Triggers and Tasks.

### Pre-requisites

Make sure your Project is set up with Trigger.dev. We recommend [using the CLI](/documentation/quickstart) to do this.

## How to write a Job in code

### 1. Create a Job file in your Project

This is where you will write your Job code. E.g. `my-job.ts`.

```ts
//this path might be different depending on your project
import { client } from "@/trigger";

client.defineJob({
  // This is the unique ID for your Job's end-point
  id: "your-job-id",
  // This is the name of your Job
  name: "Your Job name",
  // This is the version of our SDK you are using
  version: "0.0.1",
  ...
```

The `id` and `name` are important because they are used to create and identify your Job in the app.

<Note>
  This Job must be imported in the `trigger` file in order to be registered when the CLI dev command
  is run. This can be found in either the `app/api/trigger/route.ts` file if you're using the
  Next.js App Router, or `pages/api/trigger.ts` if you're using the Next.js Pages Router.
</Note>

### 2. Choose a Trigger

This is what kicks-off a Job. There are a few different types of Triggers you can use:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scheduled">
    Run a Job on a repeating schedule, using [intervalTrigger](/documentation/concepts/triggers/scheduled#interval)
    ```ts
    client.defineJob({
    ...
    trigger: intervalTrigger({
        seconds: 60,
      }),
    ...
    ```
    Or with CRON syntax, using [cronTrigger](/documentation/concepts/triggers/scheduled#using-cron-syntax):
    ```ts
    client.defineJob({
    ...
    trigger: cronTrigger({
        cron: "30 14 * * 1",
      }),
    ...
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Webhook">

    Start your Jobs when an event happens in another API. You'll need to use [Integrations](/integrations) to do this.

    Here's an example with the GitHub integration.

    ```ts
    client.defineJob({
    ...
    //E.g. When a GitHub issue is modified on the triggerdotdev/trigger.dev repo
    trigger: github.triggers.repo({
      event: events.onIssue,
      owner: "triggerdotdev",
      repo: "trigger.dev",
    }),
    ...
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Event">
    The [eventTrigger](/documentation/concepts/triggers/events) allows you to define an event that your Job listens for. 
    
    When you [send an event](/documentation/concepts/triggers/events#sending-events) with the same name the Job will run.
        
    ``` ts
    client.defineJob({
    ...
    //E.g. when a user is created in your app (you send the event)
    trigger: eventTrigger({
        name: "user.created",
        schema: z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          email: z.string(),
          paidPlan: z.boolean(),
        }),
        ...
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dynamic">
    These are advanced features that allows you to attach dynamic triggers to a Job. Full information [here](/documentation/concepts/triggers/dynamic).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Create the Job Tasks

> A Task is a resumable unit of a Run that can be retried, resumed and is logged.

<Info>
  You can use just regular code in your Jobs. But you don't get the benefits of retrying, logging
  and resumability. More info on [Tasks vs regular
  code](/documentation/concepts/tasks#tasks-vs-regular-code).
</Info>

You can string together multiple Tasks and regular code in any order you want.

**Useful built-in Tasks:**

| Task                                        | Description                                                             | Task code                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Delay](/documentation/concepts/delays)     | Wait for a period of time                                               | `await io.wait("wait", 60);`                                                         |
| [Log](/sdk/io/logger)                       | Log a message                                                           | `await io.logger.log("Hello");`                                                      |
| [Send Event](/sdk/io/sendevent)             | Send an event (for eventTrigger)                                        | `await io.sendEvent("my-event", { name: "my.event", payload: { hello: "world" } });` |
| [Run task](/sdk/io/runtask)                 | Wrap your own code in this to create a Task                             | `await io.runTask("My Task", async () => { console.log("Hello"); });`                |
| [Background fetch](/sdk/io/backgroundfetch) | Fetch data from a URL that can take longer that the serverless timeout. | `await io.backgroundFetch("fetch-some-data", { url: "https://example.com" });`       |

For a full list of built-in Tasks, see the [io SDK reference](/sdk/io).

### 4. Register your Jobs

While your app is running, open a **new terminal window or tab** and run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>

This will register all of your Jobs, they should appear in your dashboard.

<Note>
  Not seeing your Job in the web app? It might be because you forgot to import it. This will need to
  be either in `app/api/trigger/route.ts` file if you're using the Next,js App Router, or
  `pages/api/trigger.ts` if you're using the Next,js Pages Router.
