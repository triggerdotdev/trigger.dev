description: "Lots of APIs use API Keys or Personal Access Tokens to authenticate. This guide will show you how to use them."
---

## 1. Create an Integration client

```ts
//1. Import the Integration packages you want to use
import { Github } from "@trigger.dev/github";
import { OpenAI } from "@trigger.dev/openai";

//2. Create a new instance of the Integration client
// GitHub uses personal access tokens so the param is called `token`
const github = new Github({
  //this is used to identify the connection
  id: "github",
  token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN!,
});

// OpenAI uses API keys so the param is called `apiKey`
const openai = new OpenAI({
  //this is used to identify the connection
  id: "openai",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});
```

Note that we used `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN` and `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`. They're environment variables, which are a way of not putting secret values directly in your code.

For Next.js, local environment variables usually live in a `.env.local` file in the root of the project.

```bash .env.local
#...other variables above here
GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_1234567890xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-12345678xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## 2. Use the Integration client

There are two way to use Integrations in a Job:

- You can perform Tasks in the `run` function, by passing the Integration client into the `integrations` object.
- You can use webhooks to Trigger a Job.

This example automatically assigns "matt-aitken" to any new issue in the `trigger.dev` repo (lucky him).

```ts
new Job(client, {
  id: "assign-on-issue-opened",
  name: "Assign on Issue Opened",
  version: "0.1.0",
  //1. If you want to use the Integration in the run function, add it here
  integrations: { github },
  //2. If the Integration supports webhooks, you can use them here
  trigger: github.triggers.repo({
    event: events.onIssueOpened,
    owner: "triggerdotdev",
    repo: "trigger.dev",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {
    //3. Because we add `github` to Integrations, it comes through to `io.github` here
    const assignee = await io.github.addIssueAssignees("add assignee", {
      owner: payload.repository.owner.login,
      repo: payload.repository.name,
      issueNumber: payload.issue.number,
      assignees: ["matt-aitken"],
    });

    return assignee;
  },
});
```

## 3. Viewing connections in the dashboard

### The Integrations page

<Snippet file="integration-list.mdx" />

### Connected API Key Integration detail page

Some useful things on this page

1. The `id` that you gave the connection when you defined it in your code
2. The Jobs that are using this connection
