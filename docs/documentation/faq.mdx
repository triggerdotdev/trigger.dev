<Accordion title="Can I self-host Trigger.dev?">
  Yes, view our [self-hosting guide](/documentation/guides/self-hosting).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does my data get sent to your servers?">
  Only what you choose to send. The main body of your Job code runs on your
  infrastructure. For example when you do a database query, that never touches
  us. We receive data that triggers the start of a Job, any data you pass to one
  of our API Integrations, and any data you choose to log using our logging
  function. We store this to display on the Runs page of your dashboard.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Trigger.dev only support Next.js?">
  No, you'll be able to use Trigger.dev with a variety of other frameworks,
  serverless or otherwise, such as Node.js, Remix, and Express, in addition to
  Next.js.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is this different to Zapier, Pipedream etc?">
  Trigger.dev is a code-first tool that lets you create Jobs directly in your
  code, rather than using a UI builder like Zapier. This means you can stay in
  your own IDE and keep your internal data secure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run Trigger.dev locally?">
  Yes. Jobs are created in your code locally.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I build complex Jobs?">
  Yes. There’s no limit to the complexity of Jobs you can create. Jobs are
  created in code so you can write conditional, looping, branching or time
  delayed logic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a 'Run'?">
  A run is a single execution of a Job. This can be in either development,
  staging or production. [View full details](/documentation/concepts/runs).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use version control or roll-backs?">
  Yes. You create Jobs directly in your own code so it’s version controlled with
  everything else.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does it take to code up a Job?">
  A simple Job doing a couple of API calls from different services will take
  about 5 minutes to create.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you have all the Integrations I need?">
  View [our Integrations page](/integrations) to see the Integrations we
  currently support. If we don't have an Integration you need, you can request
  it or create it yourself.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Trigger.dev open source?">
  Yes, Trigger.dev is open source. We are strong supporters of open source
  software, and our first product, [jsonhero.io](https://jsonhero.io), has a
  thriving open source community. Trigger.dev follows in that tradition.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Trigger.dev a no/low-code tool?">
  No. Trigger.dev is designed for developers who want to create Jobs directly in
  code, without using a UI builder like Zapier. This allows developers to stay
  in their familiar development environment and customise their Jobs with code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can non-coders use this product?">
  Developers will need to create Jobs. However, anyone on the team can monitor
  running Jobs in the Trigger.dev dashboard.
</Accordion>
