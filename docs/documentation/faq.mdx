<Accordion title="Can I self-host Trigger.dev?">
  Yes, view our [self-hosting guide](/documentation/guides/self-hosting).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does my data get sent to your servers?">
  Only what you choose to send. The main body of your Job code runs on your infrastructure. For
  example when you do a database query, that never touches us. We receive data that triggers the
  start of a Job, any data you pass to one of our API Integrations, and any data you choose to log
  using our logging function. We store this to display on the Runs page of your dashboard.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What frameworks does Trigger.dev support?">
  You can use Trigger.dev with a variety of frameworks. You can check out [the full list
  here](/documentation/quickstarts/introduction).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run Trigger.dev locally?">
  Yes. Jobs are created in your code locally.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I build complex Jobs?">
  Yes. There’s no limit to the complexity of Jobs you can create. Jobs are created in code so you
  can write conditional, looping, branching or time delayed logic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a 'Run'?">
  A run is a single execution of a Job. This can be in either development, staging or production.
  [View full details](/documentation/concepts/runs).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use version control or roll-backs?">
  Yes. You create Jobs directly in your own code so it’s version controlled with everything else.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does it take to code up a Job?">
  A simple Job doing a couple of API calls from different services will take about 5 minutes to
  create.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you have all the Integrations I need?">
  View [our Integrations page](/integrations) to see the Integrations we currently support. If we
  don't have an Integration you need, you can request it or create it yourself.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Trigger.dev open source?">
  Yes, Trigger.dev is open source. We are strong supporters of open source software, and our first
  product, [jsonhero.io](https://jsonhero.io), has a thriving open source community. Trigger.dev
  follows in that tradition.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Trigger.dev a no/low-code tool like Zapier?">
  No. Trigger.dev is designed for developers who want to create Jobs directly in code, without using
  a UI builder like Zapier. This allows developers to stay in their familiar development environment
  and customise their Jobs with code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can non-coders use this product?">
  Developers will need to create Jobs. However, anyone on the team can monitor running Jobs in the
  Trigger.dev dashboard.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My question is not listed here">
  Hop in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nkqV9xBYWy) and ask any question you have in there! You
  could also open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev/issues/new).
