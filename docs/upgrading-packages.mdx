## Update command

Run this command in your project:

```sh
npx trigger.dev@latest update
```

This will update all of the Trigger.dev packages in your project to the latest version.

## Running the CLI locally

When you run the CLI locally use the latest version for the `dev` and `deploy` commands:

```sh
npx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

```sh
npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

These commands will also give you the option to upgrade if you are behind on versions.

## Deploying with GitHub Actions

You can deploy using [GitHub Actions](/github-actions). We recommend that you lock your version in the workflow file so make sure to upgrade.

<Warning>
  The deploy step will fail if version mismatches are detected. It's important that you update the
  version using the steps below.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your workflow file">
    In your `.githubs/workflows` folder you can find your workflow yml files. You may have a prod
    and staging one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the version for the run command">
    In the steps you'll see a `run` command. It will run the trigger.dev deploy CLI command. Make
    sure to update this version to the latest version (e.g. `npx trigger.dev@3.0.0 deploy`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## package.json dev dependency

Instead of using `npx`, `pnpm dlx` or `yarn dlx` you can add the Trigger.dev CLI as a dev dependency to your package.json file.

For example:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "trigger.dev": "3.0.0"
  }
}
```

If you've done this make sure to update the version to match the `@trigger.dev/sdk` package.

Once you have added the `trigger.dev` package to your `devDependencies`, you can use `npm exec trigger.dev`, `pnpm exec trigger.dev`, or `yarn exec trigger.dev` to run the CLI.

But we recommend adding your dev and deploy commands to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:trigger": "triggerdev dev",
    "deploy:trigger": "triggerdev deploy"
  }
}
```

Then you can run `npm run dev:trigger` and `npm run deploy:trigger` to run the CLI.
