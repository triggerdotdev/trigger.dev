description: "Configure the number of vCPUs and GBs of RAM you want the task to use."
---

The `machine` configuration is optional. Using higher spec machines will increase the cost of running the task but can also improve the performance of the task if it is CPU or memory bound.

```ts /trigger/heavy-task.ts
export const heavyTask = task({
  id: "heavy-task",
  machine: "large-1x",
  run: async ({ payload, ctx }) => {
    //...
  },
});
```

The default machine is `small-1x` which has 0.5 vCPU and 0.5 GB of RAM. You can change the default machine in your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts trigger.config.ts
import type { TriggerConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const config: TriggerConfig = {
  machine: "small-2x",
  // ... other config
};
```

## Overriding the machine when triggering

You can also override the task machine when you [trigger](/triggering) it:

```ts
await tasks.trigger<typeof heavyTask>("heavy-task", { message: "hello world" }, { machine: "large-2x" });
```

This is useful when you know that a certain payload will require more memory than the default machine. For example, you know it's a larger file or a customer that has a lot of data.

## Out Of Memory errors

Sometimes you might see one of your runs fail with an "Out Of Memory" error.

> TASK_PROCESS_OOM_KILLED. Your task ran out of memory. Try increasing the machine specs. If this doesn't fix it there might be a memory leak.

If this happens regularly you need to either optimize the memory-efficiency of your code, or increase the machine.

### Retrying with a larger machine

If you are seeing rare OOM errors, you can add a setting to your task to retry with a large machine if you get an OOM error:

```ts /trigger/heavy-task.ts
export const yourTask = task({
  id: "your-task",
  machine: "medium-1x",
  retry: {
    outOfMemory: {
      machine: "large-1x",
    },
  },
  run: async (payload: any, { ctx }) => {
    //...
  },
});
```

<Note>
  This will only retry the task if you get an OOM error. It won't permanently change the machine that a new run starts on, so if you consistently see OOM errors you should change the machine in the `machine` property.
</Note>

## Machine configurations

| Preset              | vCPU | Memory | Disk space |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| micro               | 0.25 | 0.25   | 10GB       |
| small-1x (default)  | 0.5  | 0.5    | 10GB       |
| small-2x            | 1    | 1      | 10GB       |
| medium-1x           | 1    | 2      | 10GB       |
| medium-2x           | 2    | 4      | 10GB       |
| large-1x            | 4    | 8      | 10GB       |
| large-2x            | 8    | 16     | 10GB       |
