## Triggering your task in Next.js

Here are the steps to trigger your task in the Next.js App and Pages router and Server Actions:

<Tabs>

  <Tab title="Pages Router">

    To trigger your task, you can create an API route in the `pages/api` directory. Here's an example of how you can trigger your task in the Pages router:

    ```ts pages/api/hello.ts
    // Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
    import { helloWorldTask } from "@/trigger/example";
    import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
    import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

    export default async function handler(
      req: NextApiRequest,
      res: NextApiResponse<{ id: string }>
    ) {
      const handle = await tasks.trigger<typeof helloWorldTask>(
      "hello-world",
      "James"
      );

      res.status(200).json(handle);   
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="App Router">

    App router content

    API route (same as Pages router)

    Server actions example

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Deploying your task in Next.js

Ensure you have the Trigger.dev CLI installed and are logged in.

Run the CLI deploy command

We're working on adding a [Vercel integration](/vercel-integration) to Trigger.dev. In the meantime, you can follow [this guide](/github-actions) to use GitHub Actions to deploy your tasks.

## Troubleshooting

    ### Next.js build failing due to missing API key in GitHub CI

    This issue occurs during the Next.js app build process on GitHub CI where the Trigger.dev SDK is expecting the TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY environment variable to be set at build time. Next.js attempts to compile routes and creates static pages, which can cause issues with SDKs that require runtime environment variables. The solution is to mark the relevant pages as dynamic to prevent Next.js from trying to make them static. You can do this by adding the following line to the route file:

    ```ts
    export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
    ```
