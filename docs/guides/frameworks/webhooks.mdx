## Overview

Webhooks are a way to send and receive events from external services. Triggering tasks using webhooks allow you to add real-time, event driven functionality to your app.

A webhook handler is code that executes in response to an event. They can be endpoints in your framework's routing which will be triggered by an external service, for example.

In this guide you'll learn how to set up webhook handlers and trigger tasks from them using popular frameworks.

## Frameworks featured in this guide

- [Next.js](/guides/frameworks/webhooks#nextjs-webhook-configuration), pages or app router
- [Remix](/guides/frameworks/webhooks#remix-webhook-configuration)

<Note>
  If you would like to see a webhook guide for your framework, please request it in our [Discord
  server](https://trigger.dev/discord).

## Next.js webhook configuration

### Prerequisites

- [A Next.js project, set up with Trigger.dev](/guides/frameworks/nextjs)
- [cURL](https://curl.se/) installed on your local machine. This will be used to send a POST request to your webhook handler.

### Adding a webhook handler

The webhook handler will be an API route. The location of the route file will be different depending on whether you are using the pages router or the app router.

- **Pages router** - create a new file `pages/api/webhook-handler.ts` or `pages/api/webhook-hander.js`.

- **App router** - create a new file in the `app/api/webhook-handler/route.ts` or `app/api/webhook-handler/route.js`.

The handler code will be the same for both routers. In this guide will use the 'Hello World' task as the example.

In your new file, add the following code:

```ts
import type { helloWorldTask } from "@/trigger/example";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  try {
    // Parse the webhook payload
    const webhookData = await req.json();

    // Trigger the helloWorldTask with the webhook data as the payload
    const handle = await tasks.trigger<typeof helloWorldTask>("hello-world", webhookData);

    return NextResponse.json({ result: handle, ok: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return NextResponse.json({ message: "something went wrong", ok: false }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Triggering a task locally

Now that you have a webhook handler set up, you can trigger the 'Hello World' task from it. We will do this locally using cURL.

<Steps>

<Step title="Run your Next.js app and the Trigger.dev dev server">

First, run your Next.js app.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Then, open up a second terminal window and start the Trigger.dev dev server:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Trigger the webhook with some dummy data">

To send a POST request to your webhook handler, open up a terminal window on your local machine and run the following command:

<Tip>
  If `http://localhost:3000` isn't the URL of your locally running Next.js app, replace the URL with
  that URL instead.
</Tip>

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Name": "John Doe", "Age": "87"}' http://localhost:3000/api/webhook-handler
```

This will send a POST request to your webhook handler, with a JSON payload.

</Step>

<Step title="Check the task ran successfully">

After running the command, you should see a successful dev run and a 200 response in your terminals.

If you now go to your [Trigger.dev dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev), you should also see a successful run for the 'Hello World' task, with the payload you sent, in this case; `{"name": "John Doe", "age": "87"}`.

</Step>

## Remix webhook configuration

### Prerequisites

- [A Remix project, set up with Trigger.dev](/guides/frameworks/remix)
