## Overview

This guide will show you how to set up [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with Trigger.dev, test and view an example task run.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Node.js project with a `package.json` file
- Ensure TypeScript is installed
- A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server running locally, or accessible via a connection string
- Drizzle ORM [installed and initialized](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) in your project
- A `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set in your `.env` file, pointing to your PostgreSQL database (e.g. `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname`)

## Initial setup (optional)

Follow these steps if you don't already have Trigger.dev set up in your project.

## Creating a task using Drizzle and deploying it to production

<Steps>
<Step title="The task using Drizzle">

First, create a new task file in your `trigger` folder.

This is a simple task that will add a new user to your database, we will call it `drizzle-add-new-user`.

<Note>
  For this task to work correctly, you will need to have a `users` table schema defined with Drizzle
  that includes `name`, `age` and `email` fields.
</Note>

```ts /trigger/drizzle-add-new-user.ts
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { users } from "src/db/schema";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";

// Initialize Drizzle client
const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);

export const addNewUser = task({
  id: "drizzle-add-new-user",
  run: async (payload: typeof users.$inferInsert) => {
    // Create new user
    const [user] = await db.insert(users).values(payload).returning();

    return {
      createdUser: user,
      message: "User created and updated successfully",
    };
  },
});
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configuring the build">

Next, in your `trigger.config.js` file, add `pg` to the `externals` array. `pg` is a non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js.

It is marked as an external to ensure that it is not bundled into the task's bundle, and instead will be installed and loaded from `node_modules` at runtime.

```js /trigger.config.js
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>", // Your project reference
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    external: ["pg"],
  },
});
```

</Step>

<Step title="Deploying your task">
Once the build configuration is added, you can now deploy your task using the Trigger.dev CLI.

 <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    </Step>

<Step title="Adding your DATABASE_URL environment variable to Trigger.dev">

In your Trigger.dev dashboard sidebar click "Environment Variables" <Icon icon="circle-1" iconType="solid" size={20} color="A8FF53" />, and then the "New environment variable" button <Icon icon="circle-2" iconType="solid" size={20} color="A8FF53" />.

You can add values for your local dev environment, staging and prod. in this case we will add the `DATABASE_URL` for the production environment.

</Step>

<Step title="Running your task">

    To test this task, go to the 'test' page in the Trigger.dev dashboard and run the task with the following payload:

```json
{
  "name": "<a-name>", // e.g. "John Doe"
  "age": "<an-age>", // e.g. 25
  "email": "<an-email>" // e.g. "john@doe.test"
}
```

Congratulations! You should now see a new completed run, and a new user with the credentials you provided should be added to your database.
