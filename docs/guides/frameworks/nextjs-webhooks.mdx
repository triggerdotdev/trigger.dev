## Prerequisites

- [A Next.js project, set up with Trigger.dev](/guides/frameworks/nextjs)
- [cURL](https://curl.se/) installed on your local machine. This will be used to send a POST request to your webhook handler.

## GitHub repo

## Adding the webhook handler

The webhook handler in this guide will be an API route.

This will be different depending on whether you are using the Next.js pages router or the app router.

### Pages router: creating the webhook handler

Create a new file `pages/api/webhook-handler.ts` or `pages/api/webhook-hander.js`.

In your new file, add the following code:

```ts /pages/api/webhook-handler.ts
import { helloWorldTask } from "@/trigger/example";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  // Parse the webhook payload
  const payload = req.body;

  // Trigger the helloWorldTask with the webhook data as the payload
  await tasks.trigger<typeof helloWorldTask>("hello-world", payload);

  res.status(200).json({ message: "OK" });
}
```

This code will handle the webhook payload and trigger the 'Hello World' task.

### App router: creating the webhook handler

Create a new file in the `app/api/webhook-handler/route.ts` or `app/api/webhook-handler/route.js`.

In your new file, add the following code:

```ts /app/api/webhook-handler/route.ts
import type { helloWorldTask } from "@/trigger/example";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Parse the webhook payload
  const payload = await req.json();

  // Trigger the helloWorldTask with the webhook data as the payload
  await tasks.trigger<typeof helloWorldTask>("hello-world", payload);

  return NextResponse.json("OK", { status: 200 });
}
```

This code will handle the webhook payload and trigger the 'Hello World' task.

## Triggering the task locally

Now that you have your webhook handler set up, you can trigger the 'Hello World' task from it. We will do this locally using cURL.

<Steps>

<Step title="Run your Next.js app and the Trigger.dev dev server">

First, run your Next.js app.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Then, open up a second terminal window and start the Trigger.dev dev server:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Trigger the webhook with some dummy data">

To send a POST request to your webhook handler, open up a terminal window on your local machine and run the following command:

<Tip>
  If `http://localhost:3000` isn't the URL of your locally running Next.js app, replace the URL in
  the below command with that URL instead.
</Tip>

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Name": "John Doe", "Age": "87"}' http://localhost:3000/api/webhook-handler
```

This will send a POST request to your webhook handler, with a JSON payload.

</Step>

<Step title="Check the task ran successfully">

After running the command, you should see a successful dev run and a 200 response in your terminals.

If you now go to your [Trigger.dev dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev), you should also see a successful run for the 'Hello World' task, with the payload you sent, in this case; `{"name": "John Doe", "age": "87"}`.

</Step>
