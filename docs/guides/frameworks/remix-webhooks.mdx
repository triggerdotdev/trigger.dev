## Prerequisites

- [A Remix project, set up with Trigger.dev](/guides/frameworks/remix)
- [cURL](https://curl.se/) installed on your local machine. This will be used to send a POST request to your webhook handler.

## GitHub repo

## Adding the webhook handler

The webhook handler in this guide will be an API route. Create a new file `app/routes/api.webhook-handler.ts` or `app/routes/api.webhook-handler.js`.

In your new file, add the following code:

```ts /api/webhook-handler.ts
import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import { tasks } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { helloWorldTask } from "src/trigger/example";

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const payload = await request.json();

  // Trigger the helloWorldTask with the webhook data as the payload
  await tasks.trigger<typeof helloWorldTask>("hello-world", payload);

  return new Response("OK", { status: 200 });
}
```

This code will handle the webhook payload and trigger the 'Hello World' task.

## Triggering the task locally

Now that you have a webhook handler set up, you can trigger the 'Hello World' task from it. We will do this locally using cURL.

<Steps>

<Step title="Run your Remix app and the Trigger.dev dev server">

First, run your Remix app.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Then, open up a second terminal window and start the Trigger.dev dev server:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Trigger the webhook with some dummy data">

To send a POST request to your webhook handler, open up a terminal window on your local machine and run the following command:

<Tip>
  If `http://localhost:5173` isn't the URL of your locally running Remix app, replace the URL in the
  below command with that URL instead.
</Tip>

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Name": "John Doe", "Age": "87"}' http://localhost:5173/api/webhook-handler
```

This will send a POST request to your webhook handler, with a JSON payload.

</Step>

<Step title="Check the task ran successfully">

After running the command, you should see a successful dev run and a 200 response in your terminals.

If you now go to your [Trigger.dev dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev), you should also see a successful run for the 'Hello World' task, with the payload you sent, in this case; `{"name": "John Doe", "age": "87"}`.

</Step>
