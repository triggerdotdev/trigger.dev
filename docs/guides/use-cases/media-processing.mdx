## Why Trigger.dev for media processing

### Process multi-hour videos without timeouts

Transcode videos, extract frames, or run CPU-intensive operations for hours. No execution time limits.

### Stream progress to users in real-time

Show processing status updating live in your UI. Users see exactly where encoding is and how long remains.

### Parallel processing with resource control

Process hundreds of files simultaneously with configurable concurrency limits. Control resource usage without overwhelming infrastructure.
