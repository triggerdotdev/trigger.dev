## Overview

Media processing workflows require handling large files (videos, images, audio), long-running operations, and resource-intensive transformations. Build reliable media processing pipelines in TypeScript with automatic retries, progress tracking, and no timeout limits; perfect for video transcoding, image optimization, audio processing, and AI-powered media analysis.

## Media processing workflow implementation

A typical media processing pipeline:

1. **Trigger**: Upload webhook or S3 event
2. **Download**: Fetch source file (video, image, audio, document)
3. **Process**: Transcode, resize, compress, extract frames
4. **Upload**: Store results to S3/R2/storage
5. **Cleanup**: Update database, delete temp files

Each step is durable and retryableâ€”if FFmpeg processing fails, Trigger.dev automatically retries without re-downloading the source file thanks to [checkpoint-resume](/how-it-works#the-checkpoint-resume-system) and [idempotency](/idempotency).

Trigger.dev is ideal for media processing because there are no [timeout limits](/runs/max-duration) (transcode multi-hour videos or run CPU-intensive operations indefinitely), [batchTriggerAndWait()](/triggering#yourtask-batchtriggerandwait) processes hundreds of files in parallel with [queue.concurrencyLimit](/queue-concurrency) controlling resource usage, [metadata](/runs/metadata) + [realtime](/realtime) stream processing progress to your frontend, and [wait.for()](/wait-for-token) enables human approval workflows for content moderation.

## Common media processing patterns

### Video Processing

Transform and optimize video content at scale:

- Transcode videos to multiple formats and resolutions
- Generate thumbnails and preview clips
- Add watermarks, captions, or overlays
- Extract audio tracks or video frames

### Image Processing

Optimize and transform images for any use case:

- Resize and compress for web delivery
- Generate multiple variants (thumbnails, crops, formats)
- Apply filters, effects, or branding
- Convert between formats (PNG, JPEG, WebP)

### Audio Processing

Process and transform audio files:

- Transcribe speech to text
- Convert between audio formats
- Extract audio from video files
- Apply audio effects and normalization

### Document Processing

Handle document transformation workflows:

- Convert documents to PDF
- Extract text and form data
- Generate document previews
- OCR and text extraction
