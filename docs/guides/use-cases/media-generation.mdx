## Overview

AI-powered media generation workflows require handling unpredictable API latencies, managing rate limits, and processing computationally intensive operations. Build reliable AI content generation pipelines in TypeScript with automatic retries, progress tracking, and no timeout limits; perfect for AI image generation, video synthesis, audio creation, and multi-modal content workflows.

## Basic AI media generation workflow implementation

A typical AI generation pipeline:

1. **Input**: Receive prompts, parameters, reference images
2. **Generate**: Call AI APIs (OpenAI, Replicate, Fal.ai, Stability, etc.)
3. **Post-process**: Upscale, optimize, apply transformations
4. **Review**: Human approval or automated quality checks
5. **Deliver**: Upload to storage, update database

Each step is durable and retryable—if an AI API call times out, Trigger.dev automatically retries without re-executing expensive prompt generation thanks to [checkpoint-resume](/how-it-works#the-checkpoint-resume-system) and [idempotency](/idempotency).

Trigger.dev is ideal for AI media generation because [checkpoint-resume](/how-it-works#the-checkpoint-resume-system) pauses during AI API calls (you only pay for active compute, not inference time), no [timeout limits](/runs/max-duration) means generation can take minutes or hours, [batchTriggerAndWait()](/triggering#yourtask-batchtriggerandwait) generates hundreds in parallel with [queue.concurrencyLimit](/queue-concurrency) respecting API rate limits, [metadata.stream()](/runs/metadata#stream) + [realtime](/realtime) stream previews to your frontend, and [wait.for()](/wait-for-token) adds human approval gates for brand safety.

## Common AI generation patterns

### Single Media Generation

Generate individual AI-powered content on demand:

- Generate images from text prompts
- Transform existing images with AI models
- Create variations of source images
- Apply AI filters and effects

### Batch Generation

Create content at scale for production workflows:

- Generate hundreds of product images
- Create personalized marketing assets at scale
- Generate thumbnail variations for A/B testing
- Bulk process images through AI models

### Multi-step AI Pipelines

Chain multiple AI operations for sophisticated workflows:

- Prompt generation → Image generation → Upscaling
- Image generation → Style transfer → Optimization
- Audio generation → Transcription → Translation
- Video generation → Thumbnail extraction → Metadata generation

### Human-in-the-loop

Add review and approval steps to AI workflows:

- Generate content → Human review → Publish
- AI moderation → Flagged content review → Decision
- Batch generation → Sample review → Approve batch
- Iterative refinement with human feedback
