## Benefits of using Trigger.dev for marketing workflows

**Delays without idle costs:** Wait hours or weeks between steps. Pay only for active compute, not wait time. Perfect for drip campaigns and scheduled follow-ups.

**Guaranteed delivery:** Messages send exactly once, even after retries. Personalized content isn't regenerated on failure.

**Scale without limits:** Process thousands in parallel while respecting rate limits. Send to entire segments without overwhelming APIs.

## Example worfklow patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Drip email campaign">
    Simple drip campaign. User signs up, waits specified delay, sends personalized email, tracks engagement.

<div align="center">

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[startDripCampaign] --> B[fetchUserData]
    B --> C[wait.for 24h]
    C --> D[sendPersonalizedEmail]
    D --> E[trackEngagement]
```

</div>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Multi-channel">
    **Router pattern with delay orchestration**. User action triggers campaign, router selects channel based on preferences (email/SMS/push), coordinates multi-day sequence with delays between messages, tracks engagement across channels.

<div align="center">

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[startCampaign] --> B[fetchUserProfile]
    B --> C[selectChannel]
    C --> D{Preferred<br/>Channel?}

    D -->|Email| E[sendEmail1]
    D -->|SMS| F[sendSMS1]
    D -->|Push| G[sendPush1]

    E --> H[wait.for 2d]
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[sendFollowUp]
    I --> J[trackConversion]
```

</div>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Content approval">
    **Supervisor pattern with approval gate**. Generates AI marketing content (images, copy, assets), pauses with wait.for for human review, applies revisions if needed, publishes to channels after approval.

<div align="center">

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[createCampaignAssets] --> B[generateAIContent]
    B --> C[wait.for approval]
    C --> D{Approved?}

    D -->|Yes| E[publishToChannels]
    D -->|Needs revision| F[applyFeedback]
    F --> B
```

</div>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Survey analysis">
    **Coordinator pattern with enrichment**. User completes survey, batch triggers parallel enrichment from CRM/analytics, analyzes and scores responses, updates customer profiles, triggers personalized follow-up campaigns.

<div align="center">

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[processSurveyResponse] --> B[coordinateEnrichment]
    B --> C[batchTriggerAndWait]

    C --> D[fetchCRMData]
    C --> E[fetchAnalytics]
    C --> F[fetchBehaviorData]

    D --> G[analyzeAndScore]
    E --> G
    F --> G

    G --> H[updateCRMProfile]
    H --> I[triggerFollowUp]
```

</div>
