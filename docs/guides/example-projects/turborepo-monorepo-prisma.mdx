description: "Two example projects demonstrating how to use Prisma and Trigger.dev in a Turborepo monorepo setup."
---

## Overview

These examples demonstrate two different ways of using Prisma and Trigger.dev in a Turborepo monorepo. In both examples, a task is triggered from a Next.js app using a server action, which uses Prisma to add a user to a database table. The examples differ in how Trigger.dev is installed and configured.

- Example 1: Turborepo monorepo demo with Trigger.dev and Prisma packages
- Example 2: Turborepo monorepo demo with a Prisma package and Trigger.dev installed in a Next.js app

<Note>

You can either fork the repos below, or simply check out the project structures and code to get an idea of how to set up Trigger.dev in your own monorepos.

</Note>

## Example 1: Turborepo monorepo demo with Trigger.dev and Prisma packages

This simple example demonstrates how to use Trigger.dev and Prisma as packages inside a monorepo created with Turborepo. The Trigger.dev task is triggered by a button click in a Next.js app which triggers the task via a server action.

### Features

- This monorepo has been created using the [Turborepo CLI](https://turbo.build/repo), following the official [Prisma and Turborepo docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/turborepo), and then adapted for use with Trigger.dev.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) has been used as the package manager.
- A tasks package (`@repo/tasks`) using [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) is used to create and execute tasks from an app inside the monorepo.
- A database package (`@repo/db`) using [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/) is used to interact with the database. You can use any popular Postgres database supported by Prisma, e.g. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Neon](https://neon.tech/), etc.
- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) example app (`apps/web`) to show how to trigger the task via a server action.

### Relevant files and code

#### Database package

- Prisma is added as a package in [`/packages/database`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/database/) and exported as `@repo/db` in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/database/package.json) file.
- The schema is defined in the [`prisma/schema.prisma`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma) file.

#### Tasks package

<Note>

to run `pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest init` in a blank packages folder, you have to add a `package.json` file first, otherwise it will attempt to add Trigger.dev files in the root of your monorepo.

</Note>

- Trigger.dev is added as a package in [`/packages/tasks`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/tasks) and exported as `@repo/tasks` in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/tasks/package.json) file.
- The [`addNewUser.ts`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/tasks/src/trigger/addNewUser.ts) task adds a new user to the database.
- The [`packages/tasks/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/tasks/src/index.ts) file exports values and types from the Trigger.dev SDK, and is exported from the package via the [`package.json`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/tasks/package.json) file.
- The [`packages/tasks/src/trigger/index.ts`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/tasks/src/trigger/index.ts) file exports the task from the package. Every task must be exported from the package like this.
- The [`trigger.config.ts`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/packages/tasks/trigger.config.ts) file configures the Trigger.dev project settings. This is where the Trigger.dev [Prisma build extension](https://trigger.dev/docs/config/extensions/prismaExtension) is added, which is required to use Prisma in the Trigger.dev task.

<Info>
You must include the version of Prisma you are using in the `trigger.config.ts` file, otherwise the Prisma build extension will not work. Learn more about our [Prisma build extension](/config/extensions/prismaExtension).

</Info>

#### The Next.js app `apps/web`

- The app is a simple Next.js app using the App Router, that uses the `@repo/db` package to interact with the database and the `@repo/tasks` package to trigger the task. These are both added as dependencies in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/apps/web/package.json) file.
- The task is triggered from a button click in the app in [`page.tsx`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/apps/web/app/page.tsx), which uses a server action in [`/app/api/actions.ts`](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/tree/main/monorepos/turborepo-prisma-tasks-package/apps/web/app/api/actions.ts) to trigger the task with an example payload.

## Example 2: Turborepo monorepo demo with a Prisma package and Trigger.dev installed in a Next.js app

This example demonstrates how to use Trigger.dev and Prisma in a monorepo created with Turborepo. Prisma has been added as a package, and Trigger.dev has been installed in a Next.js app. The task is triggered by a button click in the app via a server action.
