## Overview

Smart Spreadsheet is an AI-powered tool that enriches company data on demand. Input a company name or website URL and get verified information including industry, headcount, and funding details; each with source attribution. Results stream to the frontend in real-time as they're processed.

- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/) for background tasks
- [Exa](https://exa.ai/) – an AI-native search engine that returns clean, structured content ready for LLM extraction
- [Claude](https://anthropic.com/) via the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) for data extraction
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) PostgreSQL database for persistence
- Trigger.dev [Realtime](/realtime/overview) to stream updates to the frontend

## How it works

The enrichment workflow:

1. **Trigger enrichment** – User enters a company name or URL in the spreadsheet UI
2. **Parallel data gathering** – Four subtasks run concurrently to fetch basic info, industry, employee count, and funding details
3. **AI extraction** – Each subtask uses Exa search + Claude to extract structured data with source URLs
4. **Real-time updates** – Results stream back to the frontend as each subtask completes
5. **Persist results** – Enriched data is saved to Supabase with source attribution

## Features

- **Parallel processing** – All four enrichment categories run simultaneously using [batch.triggerByTaskAndWait](/triggering#batch-trigger-by-task-and-wait)
- **Source attribution** – Every data point includes the URL it was extracted from
- **Real-time streaming** – Results appear in the UI as they're processed using [Realtime](/realtime/overview)
- **Structured extraction** – Zod schemas ensure consistent data output from Claude
