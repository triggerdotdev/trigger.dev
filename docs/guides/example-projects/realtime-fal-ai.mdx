## Overview

This full stack Next.js project showcases the following:

- A Trigger.dev task which [generates an image from a prompt using Fal.ai](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/blob/main/realtime-fal-ai-image-generation/src/trigger/realtime-generate-image.ts)
- When a [form is submitted](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/blob/main/realtime-fal-ai-image-generation/src/app/page.tsx) in the UI, triggering the task using a [server action](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/blob/main/realtime-fal-ai-image-generation/src/app/actions/process-image.ts)
- Showing the [progress of the task](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/blob/main/realtime-fal-ai-image-generation/src/app/processing/%5Bid%5D/ProcessingContent.tsx) on the frontend using Trigger.dev Realtime. This also includes error handling and a fallback UI
- Once the task is completed, showing the generated image on the frontend next to the original image
