## Overview

This demo is a full stack example that uses the following:

- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app, with an [endpoint](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/blob/main/meme-generator-human-in-the-loop/src/app/endpoints/[slug]/page.tsx) for approving the generated memes
- [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) tasks to generate the images and orchestrate the waitpoint workflow
- [OpenAI DALL-E 3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images) for generating the images
- A [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/quickstart) for the human-in-the-loop step, with the approval buttons linked to the endpoint

## Relevant code

- **Meme generator task**:

  - The [memegenerator.ts](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/blob/main/meme-generator-human-in-the-loop/src/trigger/memegenerator.ts) task:
    - Generates two meme variants using DALL-E 3
    - Uses [batchTriggerAndWait](/triggering#yourtask-batchtriggerandwait) to generate multiple meme variants simultaneously (this is because you can only generate 1 image at a time with DALL-E 3)
    - Creates a [waitpoint token](/wait-for-token)
    - Sends the generated images with approval buttons to Slack for review
    - Handles the approval workflow

- **Approval Endpoint**:
  - The waitpoint approval handling is in [page.tsx](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/examples/blob/main/meme-generator-human-in-the-loop/src/app/endpoints/[slug]/page.tsx), which processes:
    - User selections from Slack buttons
    - Waitpoint completion with the chosen meme variant
    - Success/failure feedback to the approver
