import LocalDevelopment from "/snippets/local-development-extensions.mdx";
import ScrapingWarning from "/snippets/web-scraping-warning.mdx";

## Prerequisites

- A project with [Trigger.dev initialized](/quick-start)
- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/guides/installation) installed on your machine

## Overview

There are 3 example tasks to follow on this page:

1. [Basic example](/guides/examples/puppeteer#basic-example)
2. [Generate a PDF from a web page](/guides/examples/puppeteer#generate-a-pdf-from-a-web-page)
3. [Scrape content from a web page](/guides/examples/puppeteer#scrape-content-from-a-web-page)

<ScrapingWarning />

## Build configurations

To use all examples on this page, you'll first need to add these build settings to your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts trigger.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { puppeteer } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/puppeteer";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    // This is required to use the Puppeteer library
    extensions: [puppeteer()],
  },
});
```

Learn more about [build configurations](/config/config-file#build-configuration) including setting default retry settings, customizing the build environment, and more.

## Set an environment variable

Set the following environment variable in your [Trigger.dev dashboard](/deploy-environment-variables) or [using the SDK](/deploy-environment-variables#in-your-code):

```bash
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH: "/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable",
```

## Basic example

### Overview

In this example we use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to log out the title of a web page, in this case from the [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) landing page.

### Task code

```ts trigger/puppeteer-basic-example.ts
import { logger, task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";

export const puppeteerTask = task({
  id: "puppeteer-log-title",
  run: async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto("https://trigger.dev");

    const content = await page.title();
    logger.info("Content", { content });

    await browser.close();
  },
});
```

### Testing your task

There's no payload required for this task so you can just click "Run test" from the Test page in the dashboard. Learn more about testing tasks [here](/run-tests).

## Generate a PDF from a web page

### Overview

In this example we use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to generate a PDF from the [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) landing page and upload it to [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

### Task code

```ts trigger/puppeteer-generate-pdf.ts
import { logger, task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";
import { PutObjectCommand, S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";

// Initialize S3 client
const s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: "auto",
  endpoint: process.env.S3_ENDPOINT,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID ?? "",
    secretAccessKey: process.env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ?? "",
  },
});

export const puppeteerWebpageToPDF = task({
  id: "puppeteer-webpage-to-pdf",
  run: async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    const response = await page.goto("https://trigger.dev");
    const url = response?.url() ?? "No URL found";

    // Generate PDF from the web page
    const generatePdf = await page.pdf();

    logger.info("PDF generated from URL", { url });

    await browser.close();

    // Upload to R2
    const s3Key = `pdfs/test.pdf`;
    const uploadParams = {
      Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET,
      Key: s3Key,
      Body: generatePdf,
      ContentType: "application/pdf",
    };

    logger.log("Uploading to R2 with params", uploadParams);

    // Upload the PDF to R2 and return the URL.
    await s3Client.send(new PutObjectCommand(uploadParams));
    const s3Url = `https://${process.env.S3_BUCKET}.s3.amazonaws.com/${s3Key}`;
    logger.log("PDF uploaded to R2", { url: s3Url });
    return { pdfUrl: s3Url };
  },
});
```

## Scrape content from a web page

### Overview

In this example we use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) with a [BrowserBase](https://www.browserbase.com/) proxy to scrape the GitHub stars count from the [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) landing page and log it out. See [this list](/guides/examples/puppeteer#proxying) for more proxying services we recommend.

<Warning>
  When web scraping, you MUST use the technique below which uses a proxy with Puppeteer. Direct
  scraping without using `browserWSEndpoint` is prohibited and will result in account suspension.
</Warning>

### Task code

```ts trigger/scrape-website.ts
import { logger, task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import puppeteer from "puppeteer-core";

export const puppeteerScrapeWithProxy = task({
  id: "puppeteer-scrape-with-proxy",
  run: async () => {
    const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
      browserWSEndpoint: `wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${process.env.BROWSERBASE_API_KEY}`,
    });

    const page = await browser.newPage();

    try {
      // Navigate to the target website
      await page.goto("https://trigger.dev", { waitUntil: "networkidle0" });

      // Scrape the GitHub stars count
      const starCount = await page.evaluate(() => {
        const starElement = document.querySelector(".github-star-count");
        const text = starElement?.textContent ?? "0";
        const numberText = text.replace(/[^0-9]/g, "");
        return parseInt(numberText);
      });

      logger.info("GitHub star count", { starCount });

      return { starCount };
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error("Error during scraping", {
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
      });
      throw error;
    } finally {
      await browser.close();
    }
  },
});
```

## Proxying

If you're using Trigger.dev Cloud and Puppeteer or any other tool to scrape content from websites you don't own, you'll need to proxy your requests. **If you don't you'll risk getting our IP address blocked and we will ban you from our service.**

Here are a list of proxy services we recommend:

- [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/)
- [Brightdata](https://brightdata.com/)
- [Browserless](https://browserless.io/)
- [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.io/)
- [ScrapingBee](https://scrapingbee.com/)
- [Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com/)
