## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Trigger.dev to send emails using React Email.

<Note>
  This example uses [Resend](https://resend.com) as the email provider. You can use other email
  providers like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) or [Loops](https://loops.so) as well. Full list of
  their integrations can be found [here](https://react.email/docs/introduction#integrations).
</Note>

## Task code

<Warning>
  This email is built using React components. To use React components in your task, it must be a
  .tsx file.
</Warning>

```tsx trigger/sendReactEmail.tsx
import { Body, Button, Container, Head, Heading, Html, Preview } from "@react-email/components";
import { logger, task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { Resend } from "resend";

// Initialize Resend client
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

// React Email template component
const EmailTemplate = ({ name, message }: { name: string; message: string }) => (
  <Html lang="en">
    <Head />
    <Preview>New message from {name}</Preview>
    <Body style={{ fontFamily: "Arial, sans-serif", margin: "0", padding: "0" }}>
      <Container style={{ padding: "20px", maxWidth: "600px" }}>
        <Heading>Hello from Acme Inc.</Heading>
        <p>Hi {name},</p>
        <p>{message}</p>
        <Button
          href="https://trigger.dev"
          style={{
            backgroundColor: "#0070f3",
            color: "white",
            padding: "12px 20px",
            borderRadius: "8px",
          }}
        >
          Go to Acme Inc.
        </Button>
      </Container>
    </Body>
  </Html>
);

export const sendEmail = task({
  id: "send-react-email",
  run: async (payload: {
    to: string;
    name: string;
    message: string;
    subject: string;
    from?: string;
  }) => {
    try {
      logger.info("Sending email using React.email and Resend", {
        to: payload.to,
      });

      // Send the email using Resend
      const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
        // The from address needs to be a verified email address you own
        from: payload.from || "email@acmeinc.com", // Default from address
        to: payload.to,
        subject: payload.subject,
        react: <EmailTemplate name={payload.name} message={payload.message} />,
      });

      if (error) {
        logger.error("Failed to send email", { error });
        throw new Error(`Failed to send email: ${error.message}`);
      }

      logger.info("Email sent successfully", { emailId: data?.id });

      // Return the response from Resend
      return {
        id: data?.id,
        status: "sent",
      };
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error("Unexpected error sending email", { error });
      throw error;
    }
  },
});
```

## How the email should look

This example email should look like this:
![React Email](/images/react-email.png)

This is just a simple implementation, you can customize the email to be as complex as you want. Check out the [React email templates](https://react.email/templates) for more inspiration.

## Testing your task

To test this task in the [dashboard](https://cloud.trigger.dev), you can use the following payload:

```json
{
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "message": "Thank you for signing up for our service!",
  "subject": "Welcome to Acme Inc."
}
```

## Deploying your task

Deploy the task to production using the Trigger.dev CLI `deploy` command.
