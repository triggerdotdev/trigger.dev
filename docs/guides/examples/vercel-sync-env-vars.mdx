## Overview

This example shows how to automatically sync environment variables from your Vercel project to Trigger.dev.

## Build configuration

To sync environment variables from your Vercel project to Trigger.dev, you just need to add this build configuration to your `trigger.config.ts` file. This extension will then automatically run every time you deploy your project.

This code syncs encrypted environment variables, filtering them based on the current environment (production, preview, or development).

<Note>
  You need to set the `VERCEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` environment variables, or pass
  in the token and project ID as arguments to the `vercelSyncEnvVars` build extension. You can find
  / generate the `VERCEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your Vercel
  [dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/settings/tokens). Make sure the scope of the token covers
  the project you want to sync.
</Note>

```ts trigger.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { vercelSyncEnvVars } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    // Add the vercelSyncEnvVars build extension
    extensions: [vercelSyncEnvVars()],
  },
});
```

<Note>
  [Build extensions](/config/config-file#extensions) allow you to hook into the build system and
  customize the build process or the resulting bundle and container image (in the case of
  deploying). You can use pre-built extensions or create your own.
</Note>

## Running the sync operation

To run the sync operation, simply run the `deploy` command. You should see some output in the console indicating that the environment variables have been synced, and they should now be available in the Trigger.dev dashboard.

```bash
npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```
