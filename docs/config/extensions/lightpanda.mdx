<ScrapingWarning />

To use Lightpanda in your project, add these build settings to your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts trigger.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { lightpanda } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/lightpanda";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    extensions: [lightpanda()],
  },
});
```

And add the following environment variable in your Trigger.dev dashboard on the Environment Variables page:

```bash
LIGHTPANDA_BROWSER_PATH: "/usr/bin/lightpanda",
```

Follow [this example](/guides/examples/lightpanda) to get setup with Trigger.dev and Lightpanda in your project.
