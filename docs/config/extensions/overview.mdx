Build extensions allow you to hook into the build system and customize the build process or the resulting bundle and container image (in the case of deploying).

You can use pre-built extensions by installing the `@trigger.dev/build` package into your `devDependencies`, or you can create your own.

Build extensions are added to your `trigger.config.ts` file under the `build.extensions` property:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "my-project",
  build: {
    extensions: [
      {
        name: "my-extension",
        onBuildStart: async (context) => {
          console.log("Build starting!");
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

If you are using a pre-built extension, you can import it from the `@trigger.dev/build` package:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { ffmpeg } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "my-project",
  build: {
    extensions: [ffmpeg()],
  },
});
```

## Built-in extensions

Trigger.dev provides a set of built-in extensions that you can use to customize how your project is built and deployed. These extensions are available out of the box and can be configured in your `trigger.config.ts` file.
