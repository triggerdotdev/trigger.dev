If you are using Prisma, you should use the prisma build extension.

- Automatically handles copying Prisma files to the build directory
- Generates the Prisma client during the deploy process
- Optionally will migrate the database during the deploy process
- You can add the extension twice if you have multiple separate schemas in the same project (example below)

You can use it for a simple Prisma setup like this:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { prismaExtension } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/prisma";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    extensions: [
      prismaExtension({
        version: "5.19.0", // optional, we'll automatically detect the version if not provided
        schema: "prisma/schema.prisma",
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

<Note>
  This does not have any effect when running the `dev` command, only when running the `deploy`
  command.
</Note>

### Migrations

If you want to also run migrations during the build process, you can pass in the `migrate` option:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { prismaExtension } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/prisma";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    extensions: [
      prismaExtension({
        schema: "prisma/schema.prisma",
        migrate: true,
        directUrlEnvVarName: "DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED", // optional - the name of the environment variable that contains the direct database URL if you are using a direct database URL
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

### clientGenerator

If you have multiple `generator` statements defined in your schema file, you can pass in the `clientGenerator` option to specify the `prisma-client-js` generator, which will prevent other generators from being generated. Some examples where you may need to do this include when using the `prisma-kysely` or `prisma-json-types-generator` generators.

<CodeGroup>

```prisma schema.prisma
datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED")
}

// We only want to generate the prisma-client-js generator
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
}

generator kysely {
  provider     = "prisma-kysely"
  output       = "../../src/kysely"
  enumFileName = "enums.ts"
  fileName     = "types.ts"
}

generator json {
  provider = "prisma-json-types-generator"
}
```

```ts trigger.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { prismaExtension } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/prisma";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    extensions: [
      prismaExtension({
        schema: "prisma/schema.prisma",
        clientGenerator: "client",
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

### Prisma 6.6.0+

In Prisma 6.6.0+, the `output` path for the Prisma client is no longer in `node_modules` by default. This means that the `prismaExtension` will no longer work out of the box with this version. To fix this, you will need to add the following to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "prisma": {
    "schema": "prisma/schema.prisma"
  }
}
```

This will ensure that the Prisma client is generated in the correct location.

### The `copy` option

By default, the prisma schema and migrations are copied to the output directory. You can set this to false to disable this behavior.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { prismaExtension } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/prisma";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    extensions: [
      prismaExtension({
        schema: "prisma/schema.prisma",
        copy: false,
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The `prismaExtension` will inject the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable into the build process. Learn more about setting environment variables for deploying in our [Environment Variables](/deploy-environment-variables) guide.

These environment variables are only used during the build process and are not embedded in the final container image.

</Note>

### Multiple schemas

If you have multiple separate schemas in the same project you can add the extension multiple times:

```ts
prismaExtension({
  schema: 'prisma/schema/main.prisma',
  version: '6.2.0',
  migrate: false,
}),
prismaExtension({
  schema: 'prisma/schema/secondary.prisma',
  version: '6.2.0',
  migrate: false,
}),
```
