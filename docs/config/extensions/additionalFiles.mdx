description: "Use the additionalFiles build extension to copy additional files to the build directory"
---

Import the `additionalFiles` build extension and use it in your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { additionalFiles } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  // We strongly recommend setting this to false
  // When set to `false`, the current working directory will be set to the build directory, which more closely matches production behavior.
  legacyDevProcessCwdBehaviour: false, // Default: true
  build: {
    extensions: [additionalFiles({ files: ["./assets/**", "wrangler/wrangler.toml"] })],
  },
});
```

This will copy the files specified in the `files` array to the build directory. The `files` array can contain globs. The output paths will match the path of the file, relative to the root of the project.

This extension effects both the `dev` and the `deploy` commands, and the resulting paths will be the same for both.

If you use `legacyDevProcessCwdBehaviour: false`, you can then do this:

```ts
import path from "node:path";

// You can use `process.cwd()` if you use `legacyDevProcessCwdBehaviour: false`
const interRegularFont = path.join(process.cwd(), "assets/Inter-Regular.ttf");
```

<Note>The root of the project is the directory that contains the trigger.config.ts file</Note>
