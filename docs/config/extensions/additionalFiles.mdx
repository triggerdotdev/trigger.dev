description: "Use the additionalFiles build extension to copy additional files to the build directory"
---

Import the `additionalFiles` build extension and use it in your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { additionalFiles } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  // We strongly recommend setting this to false
  // When set to `false`, the current working directory will be set to the build directory, which more closely matches production behavior.
  legacyDevProcessCwdBehaviour: false, // Default: true
  build: {
    extensions: [additionalFiles({ files: ["./assets/**", "wrangler/wrangler.toml"] })],
  },
});
```

This will copy the files specified in the `files` array to the build directory. The `files` array can contain globs. The output paths will match the path of the file, relative to the root of the project.

This extension affects both the `dev` and the `deploy` commands, and the resulting paths will be the same for both.

If you use `legacyDevProcessCwdBehaviour: false`, you can then do this:

```ts
import path from "node:path";

// You can use `process.cwd()` if you use `legacyDevProcessCwdBehaviour: false`
const interRegularFont = path.join(process.cwd(), "assets/Inter-Regular.ttf");
```

<Note>The root of the project is the directory that contains the trigger.config.ts file</Note>

## Copying files from parent directories (monorepos)

When copying files from parent directories using `..` in your glob patterns, the default behavior strips the `..` segments from the destination path. This can lead to unexpected results in monorepo setups.

For example, if your monorepo structure looks like this:

```
monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── trigger/           # Contains trigger.config.ts
│   │   └── trigger.config.ts
│   └── shared/            # Directory you want to copy
│       └── utils.ts
```

Using `additionalFiles({ files: ["../shared/**"] })` would copy `utils.ts` to `shared/utils.ts` in the build directory (not `apps/shared/utils.ts`), because the `..` segment is stripped.

### Using the `destination` option

To control exactly where files are placed, use the `destination` option:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { additionalFiles } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  build: {
    extensions: [
      additionalFiles({
        files: ["../shared/**"],
        destination: "apps/shared", // Files will be placed under apps/shared/
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

With this configuration, `../shared/utils.ts` will be copied to `apps/shared/utils.ts` in the build directory.

<Note>
When using `destination`, the file structure relative to the glob pattern's base directory is preserved.
For example, `../shared/nested/file.ts` with `destination: "libs"` will be copied to `libs/nested/file.ts`.
</Note>

### Multiple directories with different destinations

If you need to copy multiple directories to different locations, use multiple `additionalFiles` extensions:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { additionalFiles } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  build: {
    extensions: [
      additionalFiles({
        files: ["../shared/**"],
        destination: "libs/shared",
      }),
      additionalFiles({
        files: ["../templates/**"],
        destination: "assets/templates",
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```
