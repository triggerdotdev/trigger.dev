description: "Use the additionalPackages build extension to include additional packages in the build"

Import the `additionalPackages` build extension and use it in your `trigger.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { additionalPackages } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    // Omit version for auto-resolution; for reproducible builds use e.g. packages: ["wrangler@X.Y.Z"]
    extensions: [additionalPackages({ packages: ["wrangler"] })],
  },
});
```

This allows you to include additional packages in the build that are not automatically included via imports. This is useful if you want to install a package that includes a CLI tool you can invoke in your tasks via `exec`. We will try to automatically resolve the version of the package but you can specify the version by using the `@` symbol.

If you omit the version, the build may use a cached or older resolution. For reproducible builds, pin the exact version (e.g. `wrangler@X.Y.Z`).

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { additionalPackages } from "@trigger.dev/build/extensions/core";

export default defineConfig({
  project: "<project ref>",
  // Your other config settings...
  build: {
    extensions: [additionalPackages({ packages: ["wrangler@X.Y.Z"] })],
  },
});
```

This extension does not do anything in `dev` mode, but it will install the packages in the build directory when you run `deploy`. The packages will be installed in the `node_modules` directory in the build directory.
