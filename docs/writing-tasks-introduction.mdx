Before digging deeper into the details of writing tasks, you should read the [fundamentals of tasks](/tasks/overview) to understand what tasks are and how they work.

| :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Logging](/logging)                          | View and send logs and traces from your tasks.                                                      |
| [Errors & retrying](/errors-retrying)        | How to deal with errors and write reliable tasks.                                                   |
| [Wait](/wait)                                | Wait for periods of time or for external events to occur before continuing.                         |
| [Concurrency & Queues](/queue-concurrency)   | Configure what you want to happen when there is more than one run at a time.                        |
| [Realtime notifications](/realtime/overview) | Send realtime notifications from your task that you can subscribe to from your backend or frontend. |
| [Versioning](/versioning)                    | How versioning works.                                                                               |
| [Machines](/machines)                        | Configure the CPU and RAM of the machine your task runs on                                          |
| [Idempotency](/idempotency)                  | Protect against mutations happening twice.                                                          |
| [Replaying](/replaying)                      | You can replay a single task or many at once with a new version of your code.                       |
| [Max duration](/runs/max-duration)           | Set a maximum duration for your task to run.                                                        |
| [Tags](/tags)                                | Tags allow you to easily filter runs in the dashboard and when using the SDK.                       |
| [Metadata](/runs/metadata)                   | Attach a small amount of data to a run and update it as the run progresses.                         |
| [Usage](/run-usage)                          | Get compute duration and cost from inside a run, or for a specific block of code.                   |
| [Context](/context)                          | Access the context of the task run.                                                                 |
| [Bulk actions](/bulk-actions)                | Run actions on many task runs at once.                                                              |
| [Priority](/runs/priority)                   | Specify a priority when triggering a task.                                                          |
| [Hidden tasks](/hidden-tasks)                | Create tasks that are not exported from your trigger files but can still be executed.               |
