| [Retrying](/v3/retrying)                           | Configure retrying of entire tasks and individual blocks of code.                                   |
| [Wait](/v3/wait)                                   | Wait for periods of time or for external events to occur before continuing.                         |

| [Testing](/v3/testing)                             | Test your tasks with payloads from the dashboard or write automated tests in code.                  |

| [Rollbacks](/v3/rollbacks)                         | Rollback code inside a task when errors happen to provide transactional guarantees.                 |
| [Using APIs](/v3/using-apis)                       | How to use APIs from within your tasks.                                                             |
