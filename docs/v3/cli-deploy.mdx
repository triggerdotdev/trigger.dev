description: "The `trigger.dev deploy` command can be used to manually deploy."
---

You run the command like this:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

</CodeGroup>

It performs a few steps to deploy:

1. Typechecks the code.
2. Compiles and bundles the code.
3. Checks that [environment variables](/v3/deploy-environment-variables) are set.
4. Deploys the code to the cloud.
5. Registers the tasks as a new version in the environment (prod by default).
