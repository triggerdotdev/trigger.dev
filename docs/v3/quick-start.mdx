In this guide we will:

1. Create a `trigger.config.mjs` file and a `/trigger` directory with an example task.
2. Get you to run the task using the CLI.
3. Show you how to view the run logs for that task.

<Steps titleSize="h3">

<Step title="Create a Trigger.dev account">

You can either:

- Use the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev).
- Or [self-host](/v3/open-source-self-hosting) the service.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first project">

Once you've created an account, follow the steps in the app to:

1. Complete your account details.
2. Create your first Organization and Project.

<Info>Make sure you create a "Version 3" project.</Info>

</Step>

<Step title="Run the CLI `init` command">

The easiest way to get started it to use the CLI. It will add Trigger.dev to your existing project, create a `/trigger` folder and give you an example task.

Run this command in the root of your project to get started:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>

It will do a few things:

1. Log you into the CLI if you're not already logged in.
2. Create a `trigger.config.mjs` file in the root of your project.
3. Ask where you'd like to create the `/trigger` directory.
4. Create the `/trigger` directory with an example task, `/trigger/example.[ts/js]`.

</Step>

<Step title="Run the CLI `dev` command">

The CLI `dev` command runs a server for your tasks. It will watches for changes in your `/trigger` directory and communicates with the Trigger.dev platform to register your tasks, perform runs, and send data back and forth.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Perform a run test using the dashboard">

The CLI `dev` command spits out various useful URLs. Right now we want to visit the Test page it provided.

You should see our Example task in the list, select it. Most tasks have a "payload" which you enter in the JSON editor, but our example task doesn't need any input.

Press the "Run test" button.

</Step>

<Step title="View your run">

Congratulations, you should see the run page which will live reload showing you the current state of the run.

If you go back to your terminal you'll see that the dev command also shows tasks that are running and links to the run log.

</Step>
