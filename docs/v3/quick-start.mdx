In this guide we will:

1. Create a `trigger.config.ts` file and a `/trigger` directory with an example task.
2. Get you to run the task using the CLI.
3. Show you how to view the run logs for that task.

<Steps titleSize="h3">

<Step title="Create a Trigger.dev account">

You can either:

- Use the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev).
- Or [self-host](/v3/open-source-self-hosting) the service.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first project">

Once you've created an account, follow the steps in the app to:

1. Complete your account details.
2. Create your first Organization and Project.

<Warning>
  Make sure you create a "Version 3" project. You might need to [request early
  access](https://trigger.dev/v3-early-access).
