## Concurrency limits

These are the default limits on a free account.

Before we introduce paid plans in July you can request more [on Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) or by [contacting us](https://trigger.dev/contact). If you increase these defaults you may have to subscribe to a paid plan when we introduce them. For more details on the v3 Cloud pricing see the [pricing page](https://trigger.dev/blog/v3-developer-preview-launch#cloud-pricing).

| Limit        | Details            |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Organization | 10 concurrent runs |
| Environment  | 5 concurrent runs  |

## Rate limits

| Limit | Details                   |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| API   | 1,500 requests per minute |

Generally speaking each SDK call is an API call.

The most common cause of hitting the API rate limit is if you're calling `trigger()` on a task in a loop, instead of doing this use `batchTrigger()` which will trigger multiple tasks in a single API call. You can have up to 100 tasks in a single batch trigger call.
