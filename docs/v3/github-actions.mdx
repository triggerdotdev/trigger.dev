This simple GitHub action file will deploy you Trigger.dev tasks when new code is pushed to the `main` branch and the `trigger` directory has changes in it.

<Warning>The deploy step will fail if any version mismatches are detected. Please see the [version pinning](/v3/github-actions#version-pinning) section for more details.</Warning>

```yaml .github/workflows/release-trigger-staging.yml
name: Deploy to Trigger.dev (staging)

# Requires manually calling the workflow from a branch / commit to deploy to staging
on:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20.x"
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: ðŸš€ Deploy Trigger.dev
        env:
          TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          npx trigger.dev@beta deploy --env staging
```

If you already have a GitHub action file, you can just add the final step "ðŸš€ Deploy Trigger.dev" to your existing file.

You need to add the `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret to your repository. You can create a new access token by going to your profile page and then clicking on the "Personal Access Tokens" tab.

To set it in GitHub go to your repository, click on "Settings", "Secrets and variables" and then "Actions". Add a new secret with the name `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and use the value of your access token.

## Version pinning

The CLI and `@trigger.dev/*` package versions need to be in sync, otherwise there will be errors and unpredictable behavior. Hence, the `deploy` command will automatically fail during CI on any version mismatches.

To ensure a smooth CI experience you can pin the CLI version in the deploy step, like so:

```yaml .github/workflows/release-trigger.yml
- name: ðŸš€ Deploy Trigger.dev
  env:
    TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    npx trigger.dev@3.0.0-beta.16 deploy
```

You should use the version you run locally during dev and manual deploy. The current version is displayed in the banner, but you can also check it by appending `--version` to any command.
