This simple GitHub action file will deploy your Trigger.dev tasks when new code is pushed to the `main` branch and the `trigger` directory has changes in it.

<Warning>
  The deploy step will fail if any version mismatches are detected. Please see the [version
  pinning](/v3/github-actions#version-pinning) section for more details.

If you already have a GitHub action file, you can just add the final step "🚀 Deploy Trigger.dev" to your existing file.

You need to add the `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret to your repository. You can create a new access token by going to your profile page and then clicking on the ["Personal Access Tokens"](https://cloud.trigger.dev/account/tokens) tab.

To set it in GitHub go to your repository, click on "Settings", "Secrets and variables" and then "Actions". Add a new secret with the name `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and use the value of your access token.

<Accordion title="How to add TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN in GitHub">
  1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
  2. Click on "Settings".
  3. Click on "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions"
  4. Click on "New repository secret".
  5. Add the name `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and the value of your access token.

## Version pinning

The CLI and `@trigger.dev/*` package versions need to be in sync, otherwise there will be errors and unpredictable behavior. Hence, the `deploy` command will automatically fail during CI on any version mismatches.
Tip: add the deploy command to your `package.json` file to keep versions managed in the same place. For example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:trigger-prod": "npx trigger.dev@3.0.0-beta.34 deploy",
    "deploy:trigger": "npx trigger.dev@3.0.0-beta.34 deploy --env staging"
  }
}
```
Your workflow file will follow the version specified in the `package.json` script, like so:

```yaml .github/workflows/release-trigger.yml
- name: 🚀 Deploy Trigger.dev
  env:
    TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    npm run deploy:trigger
```

You should use the version you run locally during dev and manual deploy. The current version is displayed in the banner, but you can also check it by appending `--version` to any command.
