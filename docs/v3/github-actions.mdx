This simple GitHub action file will deploy you Trigger.dev tasks when new code is pushed to the `main` branch and the `trigger` directory has changes in it.

```yaml .github/workflows/release-trigger.yml
name: Deploy to Trigger.dev

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - "trigger/**"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js 20.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20.x"

      - name: 🚀 Deploy Trigger.dev
        env:
          TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          npx trigger.dev@beta deploy
```

If you already have a GitHub action file, you can just add the final step "🚀 Deploy Trigger.dev" to your existing file.

You need to add the `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret to your repository. You can create a new access token by going to your profile page and then clicking on the "Personal Access Tokens" tab.

To set it in GitHub go to your repository, click on "Settings", "Secrets and variables" and then "Actions". Add a new secret with the name `TRIGGER_ACCESS_TOKEN` and use the value of your access token.
