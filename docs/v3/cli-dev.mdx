This runs a server on your machine that can execute Trigger.dev tasks:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>

You will see in the terminal that the server is running and listening for requests. When you run a task, you will see it in the terminal along with a link to view it in the dashboard.

It is worth noting that each task runs in a separate Node process. This means that if you have a long-running task, it will not block other tasks from running.

You can [attach a local debugger](/v3/local-debugger) using the dev command.
