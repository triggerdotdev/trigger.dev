This runs a server on your machine that can execute Trigger.dev tasks:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@beta dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@beta dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@beta dev
```

</CodeGroup>

You will see in the terminal that the server is running and listening for requests. When you run a task, you will see it in the terminal along with a link to view it in the dashboard.

It is worth noting that each task runs in a separate Node process. This means that if you have a long-running task, it will not block other tasks from running.

## Options

### Attaching a local debugger

You can use the `--debugger` flag to run the server in debug mode. This will allow you to attach a debugger to the server and debug your tasks.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx trigger.dev@beta dev --debugger
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx trigger.dev@beta dev --debugger
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx trigger.dev@beta dev --debugger
```

</CodeGroup>
