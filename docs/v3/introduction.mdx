## What is Trigger.dev (v3)?

Trigger.dev v3 makes it easy to write reliable long-running tasks without timeouts.

- We run your tasks with no timeouts. You don't have to manage any infrastructure (unless you [self-host](/v3/open-source-self-hosting)). Workers are automatically scaled and managed for you.
- We provide a multi-tenant queue that is used when triggering tasks.
- We provide an SDK and CLI for writing tasks in your existing codebase, inside [/trigger folders](/v3/trigger-folder).
- We provide different types of tasks: [regular](/v3/tasks-regular) and [scheduled](/v3/tasks-scheduled).
- We provide a dashboard for monitoring, debugging, and managing your tasks.

We're [open source](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev) and you can choose to use the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev) or [Self-host Trigger.dev](/v3/open-source-self-hosting) on your own infrastructure.
