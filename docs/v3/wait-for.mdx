Inside your tasks you can wait for a period of time before you want execution to continue.

```ts /trigger/long-task.ts
export const veryLongTask = task({
  id: "very-long-task",
  run: async (payload) => {
    await wait.for({ seconds: 5 });

    await wait.for({ minutes: 10 });

    await wait.for({ hours: 1 });

    await wait.for({ days: 1 });

    await wait.for({ weeks: 1 });

    await wait.for({ months: 1 });

    await wait.for({ years: 1 });
  },
});
```

This allows you to write linear code without having to worry about the complexity of scheduling or managing CRON jobs.
