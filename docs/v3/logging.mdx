![The run log
  ](/images/v3/run-log.png)

The [run log](/v3/dashboard-runs) shows you exactly what happened in every run of your tasks. It is comprised of logs, traces and spans.

## Logs

You can use `console.log()`, `console.error()`, etc as normal and they will be shown in your run log.

```ts /trigger/logging.ts
import { task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const loggingExample = task({
  id: "logging-example",
  run: async (payload: { data: Record<string, string> }) => {
    console.log("Log message", payload.data, [1, 2, 3]);
    console.warn("You've been warned", payload.data);
    console.error("Error message", payload.data);
    console.info("Info message", payload.data);
  },
});
```

This is the standard function so you can use it as you would in any other JavaScript or TypeScript code. Logs from any functions/packages will also be shown.

## Tracing and spans

Tracing is a way to follow the flow of your code. It's very useful for debugging and understanding how your code is working, especially with long-running or complex tasks.

Trigger.dev uses OpenTelemetry tracing under the hood. With automatic tracing for many things like task triggering, task attempts, HTTP requests, and more.

### Automatic instrumentation

| Name          | Description                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Task triggers | Task triggers.                   |
| Task attempts | Task attempts.                   |
| HTTP requests | HTTP requests made by your code. |
| OpenAI        | OpenAI SDK calls.                |

## Add custom traces

If you want to add custom traces to your code, you can use the `logger.trace` function. It will create a new OTEL trace and you can set attributes on it.

```ts
import { logger, task } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const customTrace = task({
  id: "custom-trace",
  run: async (payload) => {
    //you can wrap code in a trace, and set attributes
    const user = await logger.trace("fetch-user", async (span) => {
      span.setAttribute("user.id", "1");

      //...do stuff

      //you can return a value
      return {
        id: "1",
        name: "John Doe",
        fetchedAt: new Date(),
      };
    });

    const usersName = user.name;
  },
});
```
