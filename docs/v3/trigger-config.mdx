Let's take a look at a basic `trigger.config.ts` file. This is generated for you when you follow [the quick start guide](/v3/quick-start). This file is used to configure your project and how it's bundled.

```ts trigger.config.ts
import type { TriggerConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const config: TriggerConfig = {
  //Your project ref (you can see it on the Project settings page in the dashboard)
  project: "proj_gtcwttqhhtlasxgfuhxs",
  retries: {
    //If you want to retry a task in dev mode (when using the CLI)
    enabledInDev: false,
    //the default retry settings. Used if you don't specify on a task.
    default: {
      maxAttempts: 3,
      minTimeoutInMs: 1000,
      maxTimeoutInMs: 10000,
      factor: 2,
      randomize: true,
    },
  },
  //The paths for your trigger folders
  triggerDirectories: ["./trigger"],
};
```

Most of the time you don't need to change anything in this file, or if you do then we will tell you when you the run the CLI command.

## Instrumentations

We use OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for our run logs. This means you get a lot of information about your tasks with no effort. But you probably want to add more information to your logs. For example, here's all the Prisma calls automatically logged:

![The run log
  ](/images/v3/auto-instrumentation.png)

Here we add Prisma and OpenAI instrumentations to your `trigger.config.ts` file.

```ts trigger.config.ts
import type { TriggerConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";
import { PrismaInstrumentation } from "@prisma/instrumentation";
import { OpenAIInstrumentation } from "@traceloop/instrumentation-openai";

export const config: TriggerConfig = {
  //..other stuff
  instrumentations: [new PrismaInstrumentation(), new OpenAIInstrumentation()],
};
```

## ESM-only packages

We'll let you know when running the CLI dev command if this is a problem. Some packages are ESM-only so they don't work directly from CJS when using Node.js. In that case you need to add them to the `dependenciesToBundle` array in your `trigger.config.ts` file.

```ts trigger.config.ts
import type { TriggerConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

export const config: TriggerConfig = {
  //..other stuff
  //either regex or strings of package names
  dependenciesToBundle: [/@sindresorhus/, "escape-string-regexp"],
};
```

## Prisma (and other generators)

Prisma works by generating a client from your `prisma.schema` file. This means you need to do a couple of things to get it to work with Trigger:

<Steps>

  <Step title="package.json postinstall `prisma generate`">


    <CodeGroup>

    ```json default path
    {
      "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "prisma generate"
      }
    }
    ```

    ```json custom path
    {
      "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "prisma generate --schema=./custom/path/to/schema.prisma"
      }
    }
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Anything you put in `postinstall` will be run as part of the install step. This is how Next.js recommends you set up Prisma anyway.

</Step>

  <Step title="Add prisma and the schema to trigger.config.ts">

    ```ts trigger.config.ts
    import type { TriggerConfig } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

    export const config: TriggerConfig = {
      //..other stuff

      // using the default path
      additionalFiles: ["./prisma/schema.prisma"],
      // or a custom path, for example in a monorepo
      additionalFiles: ["../../custom/path/to/schema.prisma"],

      additionalPackages: ["prisma@5.11.0"],
    };
    ```

    This tells Trigger to bundle the Prisma client and the schema file.

</Step>

</Steps>
