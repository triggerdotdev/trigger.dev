description: Using the Trigger.dev management API
---

## Installation

The management API is available through the same `@trigger.dev/sdk` package used in defining and triggering tasks. If you have already installed the package in your project, you can skip this step.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @trigger.dev/sdk@latest
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @trigger.dev/sdk@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @trigger.dev/sdk@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

All `v3` functionality is provided through the `@trigger.dev/sdk/v3` module. You can import the entire module or individual resources as needed.

```ts
import { configure, runs } from "@trigger.dev/sdk/v3";

configure({
  // this is the default and if the `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set, can omit calling configure
  secretKey: process.env["TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY"],
});

async function main() {
  const runs = await runs.list({
    limit: 10,
    status: ["COMPLETED"],
  });
}

main().catch(console.error);
```
