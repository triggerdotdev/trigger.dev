## Development

### `EACCES: permission denied`

If you see this error:

```ts
6090 verbose stack Error: EACCES: permission denied, rename '/Users/user/.npm/_cacache/tmp/f1bfea11' -> '/Users/user/.npm/_cacache/content-v2/sha512/31/d8/e094a47a0105d06fd246892ed1736c02eae323726ec6a3f34734eeb71308895dfba4f4f82a88ffe7e480c90b388c91fc3d9f851ba7b96db4dc33fbc65528'
```

First, clear the npm cache:

```ts
npm cache clean --force
```

Then change the permissions of the npm folder (if 1 doesn't work):

```ts
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
```

## Deployment

Running the [trigger.dev deploy] command builds and deploys your code. Sometimes there can be issues building your code.

You can run the deploy command with `--log-level debug` at the end. This will spit out a lot of information about the deploy. If you can't figure out the problem from the information below please join [our Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) and create a help forum post. Do NOT share the extended debug logs publicly as they might reveal private information about your project.

You can also review the build by supplying the `--dry-run` flag. This will build your project but not deploy it. You can then inspect the build output on your machine.

Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### `Failed to build project image: Error building image`

There should be a link below the error message to the full build logs on your machine. Take a look at these to see what went wrong. Join [our Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) and you share it privately with us if you can't figure out what's going wrong. Do NOT share these publicly as the verbose logs might reveal private information about your project.

### `Deployment encountered an error`

Usually there will be some useful guidance below this message. If you can't figure out what's going wrong then join [our Discord](https://trigger.dev/discord) and create a Help forum post with a link to your deployment.

## Project setup issues

### `The requested module 'node:events' does not provide an export named 'addAbortListener'`

If you see this error it means you're not a supported version of Node:

```
SyntaxError: The requested module 'node:events' does not provide an export named 'addAbortListener'
at ModuleJob._instantiate (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:123:21)
at async ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:189:5)

Node.js v19.9.0
```

You need to be on at least these minor versions:

| Version | Minimum |
| ------- | ------- |
| 18      | 18.20+  |
| 20      | 20.5+   |
| 21      | 21.0+   |
| 22      | 22.0+   |

## Runtime issues

### `Environment variable not found:`

Your code is deployed separately from the rest of your app(s) so you need to make sure that you set any environment variables you use in your tasks in the Trigger.dev dashboard. [Read the guide](/deploy-environment-variables).

### `Error: @prisma/client did not initialize yet.`

Prisma uses code generation to create the client from your schema file. This means you need to add a bit of config so we can generate this file before your tasks run: [read the guide](/config/config-file#prisma).

### When triggering subtasks the parent task finishes too soon

Make sure that you always use `await` when you call `trigger`, `triggerAndWait`, `batchTrigger`, and `batchTriggerAndWait`. If you don't then it's likely the task(s) won't be triggered because the calling function process can be terminated before the networks calls are sent.

## Framework specific issues

### NestJS swallows all errors/exceptions

If you're using NestJS and you add code like this into your tasks you will prevent any errors from being surfaced:

```ts
export const simplestTask = task({
  id: "nestjs-example",
  run: async (payload) => {
    //by doing this you're swallowing any errors
    const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(AppModule);
    await app.init();

    //etc...
  },
});
```

NestJS has a global exception filter that catches all errors and swallows them, so we can't receive them. Our current recommendation is to not use NestJS inside your tasks. If you're a NestJS user you can still use Trigger.dev but just don't use NestJS inside your tasks like this.

### React is not defined

If you see this error:

```ts
Worker failed to start ReferenceError: React is not defined
```

Either add this to your file:

```ts
import React from "react";
```

Or change the tsconfig jsx setting:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    //...
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  }
}
```
